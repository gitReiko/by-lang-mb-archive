They accept recruits from all over Calradia, either forcefully or through persuasion. In addition, they capture wanderers, often in the desert, and convert them to their cause through perhaps the most psychologically advanced methods of the age. They are led by Vlyna, a highly controversial man. Some call him a cheat, others a prophet; most history books refer to him as an epileptic, and some even a schizophrenic. Regardless, it is certain that he is a tactical genius, as the HQ of the Desert Cult has never been found. Of course, the desert cult uses his mystery and facts such as the HQ never being found as a talking point about God's favour shining upon them, thus bringing in even more recruits. Their forces can be seen sacking villages to gather loot for their cause, as well as burning down the places of worship of the infidels.">

Though this was initially the exhortations of a few priests, knights all over Calradia started to take a liking to this idea. These knights then formed the Redemptive Order, which sought to punish all who 'obstructed God's grace shining upon' Calradia. The order captures those who it deems to be the disruptors of peace, and either retrains or executes them. Their methods and the intricacies of their organization are mostly unknown. The membership of the order seems to increase directly after kingdoms suffering heavy losses or economic hardship. Some say that this spike is due to the knights seeing with their own eyes the travesties of war; others say that this is due to the lords running out of money to pay the knights.">
