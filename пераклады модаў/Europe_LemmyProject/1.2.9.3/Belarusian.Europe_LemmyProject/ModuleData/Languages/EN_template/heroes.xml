  <string id="lord_seljuk_1a.text" text="Berkyaruq was the fifth sultan of the Seljuk Empire from 1094 to 1105. The son and successor of Malik-Shah I, he reigned during the opening stages of the decline and fragmentation of the empire, which marked the rise of Turkoman atabegates and principalities, which would eventually stretch from Kirman to Anatolia and Syria. His reign was marked by internal strife, mainly against other Seljuk princes. By his death in 1105, his authority had largely vanished. His infant son Malik-Shah II briefly succeeded him, until he was killed by Berkyaruq's half-brother and rival Muhammad I Tapar."/>
