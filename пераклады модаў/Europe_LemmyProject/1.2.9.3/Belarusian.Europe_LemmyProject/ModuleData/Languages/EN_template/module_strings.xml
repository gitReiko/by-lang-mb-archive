  <string id="EMkaeD9M" text="Hmm. Many men would begin their story by reciting their ancestry. I will not do this. A man should be judged on his own deeds, and a long list of ancestors does him no credit. Also, my family does not acknowledge me, so why should I acknowledge them?"/>
  <string id="RaSZtTqh" text="I was the son of a slave. My master, a judge, raised me in his house, but it was clear that he would never spend much time to ensure my success in the world. Still, I was tutored with his other sons, and chose to study medicine as a young man. I thought I could perhaps be a physician."/>
  <string id="9AIyvTmF" text="Well... I was soon disabused of this idea. A doctor starting out in the world must either have a great deal of money, or family that ensures him a long list of clients. I had neither. Instead of working in the city, I took service aboard a ship."/>
  <string id="ZuHolx2r" text="Professionally, it was perhaps the best thing I could have done. Fevers, injuries, festering sores - the seaman has in greater number and variety than any manner of land-dweller, I imagine. But I have little patience for life aboard, the monotony, the tyranny of captains, the lack of any space to oneself, the groaning of timbers, the constant smell of rotting bilge..."/>
  <string id="A9r6SnWx" text="Yes, it must be trying."/>

  <string id="vgcTdEvc" text="I was the son of a slave, but my father bought me my freedom and an apprenticeship with a healer. I could make a lot of money as a doctor if I came from a well-known family that would attract patients. But I don't, so I offer my skills to war-leaders, who cannot afford to be so picky."/>

  <string id="ikWAfIHX" text="Now some people will tell you that Zais was born of out wedlock, but those are lies. He was the legitimate son of Ghutan, and Rasad 'Ban Ghutan' doesn't deserve that name, he should be called the 'Bastard,' not Zais. Anyway, as for Ghutan's father... Well, not everyone knows this, but..."/>
  <string id="Wz71n66t" text="I'm sorry. Are you not paying attention?"/>
  <string id="N9rVRfaW" text="Oh.. Of course I am! This is fascinating. But tell me about your own deeds."/>
  <string id="SYBe3aIC" text="Do you have a trade? Any skills? Or just a string of ancestors?"/>
  <string id="KGa4gmDW" text="Ah, yes - well, it would be beneath someone with a lineage like mine to pledge allegiance to the current parvenus who call themselves the emirs of the ayyubid. So, I fight for those who pay me my value in denars, good noble denars."/>
  <string id="vKSGJNxT" text="I am a warrior. I would recite to you my lineage, but that would take an hour. I would tell you my deeds, but that would take two. So, instead - if you pay me - I shall come with you and fight your enemies, and that will be the best demonstration of my mettle."/>
  <string id="AVqbfwrh" text="I will tell you. Perhaps you will think I am petty-minded, but a man's reputation is a valuable thing..."/>
  <string id="TNOM6nuo" text="I am from one of the lesser known clans of the ayyubid. We take the name of an undistinguished younger son of the Qildi line from five generations back. We have never held fiefs or won much wealth, but when the Qild called out their kinfolk, or the tribes were summoned by the Sultan, we took our place in the battle line."/>
  <string id="H8wpFACA" text="The great names in our great clans - some of them are brave, and generous with the loot, but don't they like to take their names bandied out after every battle? Poets know there's silver in it if they sing the praises of the Banu Qild, the Banu Sarran - but those of us who are Banu Nobody, well, we deserve a bit of time in the sun too, don't you think?"/>
  <string id="2BKMNXE7" text="I fought three battles under the banner of the Sultan, and two more under the banners of the Qild. No more."/>
  <string id="AMMXrcC9" text="Indeed. Glory is as much a spoil of war as any, and should be shared."/>
  <string id="iztRBaaF" text="Frankly, I have little time for glory-hounds of any sort. Men who do their job is what I want."/>
  <string id="lQ4PPsnT" text="At any rate, I will find a master who allows me to win fame for myself. Or barring that, land and silver, so that I can buy a poet or two."/>
  <string id="q71Cbib7" text="I am a warrior, but I am not from one of the greater clans. After a battle, I may get a bloodstained weapon pried from the enemy's hand or a pat on the head from my emir, but no song of my deeds. No robe of honor. I intend to fight for someone who see in people more than their name."/>
  <string id="2PZsQPty" text="I will tell you my story. I haven't... I haven't spoken of this before, to anyone. Perhaps it's the wine here. But know that if you speak of this to anyone else, I'll cut your tongue out."/>
  <string id="Agbh1AmR" text="I have a gift... From the Heavens, perhaps, or perhaps from somewhere else. I have never met anyone I could not kill in a fair fight. But I do not like wars. Armies are full of crude men, boasters, drunks, rapists. I have another speciality."/>
  <string id="33Dzgon7" text="Say you had a man you wanted killed. Who you would pay to kill. I could find him, bump into him, mutter an insult. He would pull out his blade. And that would be the last mistake he would ever make. But as I said, it would be a fair fight. I do not kill from behind. It is dishonorable."/>
  <string id="PHVJ9fOm" text="But there was a lord, a customer of mine, who had no honor. And he refused to pay me. And having no honor, he laughed at my insults. He did not pull his blade. He had his men drive me away. I can kill one man but not three at once. So here I am."/>
  <string id="mijieuku" text="You know, I'm sure you could put your gift to better use."/>
  <string id="0dQLkzEw" text="What you call 'honor'... I'm not sure that's the best word for it."/>
  <string id="OHFZ9EAk" text="Mmm.... Well, for now, I do not know what to do with myself. Perhaps I could consider joining a warband, if the commander was well-bred and kept his word."/>
  <string id="KNQCoxIJ" text="I am a sword for hire. Some think us scum but I have my own code of honor. If I kill a man, it must be in a fair fight. My last employer asked me to do something dishonorable, so now I am looking for a new employer."/>
  <string id="XVZGCB0a" text="Yeah, sure."/>
  <string id="LjkQ4fYp" text="I come from a town where every alley has its 'protector.' These are men with some strength but also a lot of respect, who stand up for the rights of the people there. My father was our alley's protector, and so it fell on me to take his job after he grew too old to do it himself."/>
  <string id="Z8TfQDSV" text="A few years after he retired, we had a new guard captain. We protectors, we serve the state, but we're not its tool. This new captain didn't understand. He'd come to me and say, 'One of my lads took this man's daughter - see that he doesn't make a fuss,' or, 'Let's have little private meetings, so you can tell us what your people are up to.' "/>
  <string id="PWpTT0NM" text="I told the captain that I couldn't do these things. The alley people - they had to trust me. The captain didn't take 'no' for an answer. He pressured me. He threatened my father. What could I do? I couldn't betray my people but I couldn't betray my father either. I took my family and left."/>
  <string id="yXhf3AJk" text="A hard choice."/>
  <string id="nlRg040C" text="Better to have properly constituted authority than that of some back-alley tough."/>
  <string id="Vwhnrf66" text="So here I am. I have mouths to feed, and the thing I know best is to fight."/>
  <string id="zTNhw5T6" text="I'm from a town near here. I won't say which one... Our family were protectors of our alley, and by that I mean that I thumped the head of anyone who tried to take away our rights. But the guard captain, he kept coming around demanding money and favors, and I couldn't thump his head. So now I'm looking for new work."/>
  <string id="41Et3Siz" text="You want a story? Then go toss a copper to a fellow who knows the song of Kais and Layali, because you won't get one from me."/>
  <string id="DRv6hB6p" text="Here's what you need to know about me - I can take a man down with a single blow, or maybe two if he's got armor, and I have expensive tastes in wine and women. So I don't work for free."/>
  <string id="37d1A0AM" text="I kill for a living. Some men, in my line of work, will spin a tale of how they were forced into it, orphans of war or some-such. Piss on that."/>
  <string id="osaIOFNx" text="I like to fight, I'm good at it, and in my opinion, the Heavens smile on a man who loves his job."/>
  <string id="iZPiYDbj" text="Can't fault you for enthusiasm, I suppose."/>
  <string id="kzvTFUbj" text="That's a rather unique theology."/>
  <string id="r8vQ3KpJ" text="You want me to kill for you? Then make me an offer. If not, piss off."/>
  <string id="wGyCPQwG" text="I kill for a living. If you want me to kill for you, pay me what I'm worth. If you don't, then don't waste my time."/>
  <string id="5QpIypgB" text="Since you ask who I am, stranger, I will tell you."/>
  <string id="Ke9L8QbX" text="The searing gravel plain knows me, as do the rippling sands and the shadowed canyon. The hidden spring whispers to me, 'Come hither and drink,' and the high outcrop unveils to me the horizons."/>
  <string id="fELWdbuL" text="The viper does not trouble me, nor does the scorpion. I have faced the scouring sandstorm, the rushing flood, the killing heat of noontime, and they have all said to me, 'Pass safely, brother.'"/>
  <string id="rP2EVSvT" text="I am {MET_WANDERER.FIRSTNAME}, prince of the wastelands, lord of solitude, master of emptiness. If you wish to know my other names, you may ask my kinsmen, the leopard, the hyena and the gazelle.."/>
  <string id="xagl8d4w" text="{MET_WANDERER.FIRSTNAME} is fine. No need to bother the hyenas. So, what can you do?"/>
  <string id="5d6Xifm1" text="Master of empty talk, rather."/>
  <string id="C5pqZtNs" text="I roam the desert. I learn its secret ways, its gifts, as a lover learns the secrets and gifts of his beloved. But though the desert is bountiful, horses and steel must be bought with silver. So, I must sell my services from time to time."/>
  <string id="V6boHnpo" text="I am of the desert. I know its ways. The wind guides me. The scorpion comes into my camp at night and tells me its secrets. The howls of the jackal bring me news of the hunt."/>
  <string id="AH4ell4y" text="Hmf. Very well. I'll tell you - and you can decide for yourself whether my family should be ashamed of me."/>
  <string id="KbP87Fzv" text="I was part of a clan that lived beyond the mountains to the south. We came under pressure from our neighbors, who wanted to take our lush grazing grounds in the foothills. We were an ancient clan, that valued its name, but in this generation we have been short of men, so I fought alongside my brothers - indeed, I slew our enemies' champion in single combat. That stopped the pressure on our lands, but not the violence. "/>
  <string id="lwvQCrG2" text="We kept our grazing grounds. But my brothers and cousins found that, when they mingled with other clans during the holy months of truce, that they were mocked. 'You let your women do your fighting!'"/>
  <string id="X8Zkp0Ut" text="The insults were many, and they had no choice but to respond. One cousin was slain in a duel, one cousin killed his opponent, so we had two new bloodfeuds on our hands. I chose to leave home before it got any worse."/>
  <string id="VJDZp4rM" text="An impossible situation..."/>
  <string id="zZfHxtS5" text="Honor must come first!"/>
  <string id="2ZiWirPM" text="I find that I like to fight, and the pay is good. But I will do my fighting far from home, so that no shame attaches itself to my family's name."/>
  <string id="8TabS6RW" text="I was a daughter of a wealthy clan. But our rivals drove us from our grazing grounds. We had to sell our herds. We were mocked in towns when we went to trade in the marketplace. Luckily my father was one of those wise enough to teach his daughters to fight. With the Heavens' help I will become wealthy and famous, and restore our family name."/>
  <string id="1ssGvu9j" text="I can tell you my story. If you spend time among merchants, I suppose you will hear it anyway, told as a cautionary tale, complete with a great deal of moralizing and tut-tutting."/>
  <string id="Gepa1szA" text="My father was a merchant. When he died, he left his children a small inheritance. Most went to my brothers. They headed east, to the lands of the Padishah, leaving me in charge of our interests in Calradia. For me to step into my father's shoes, and be treated as an equal by other merchants, I knew I had to make a lot of money in a short time or they would elbow me out of the market."/>
  <string id="jnbQL2ta" text="I had an opportunity to buy pepper from another trader who was selling at a discount, and needed cash. I of course inspected the pepper and its storage. I interviewed the watchmen at the warehouse. You can trust us madame,' they said. 'Rest assured your pepper is in good hands.'"/>
  <string id="YOzdVTeS" text="But one of them kept a brazier lit at night, for the warmth, and a camel kicked it into a bed of straw when he was off relieving himself. When he returned, the warehouse was in flames. And so became penniless."/>
  <string id="EB6RcaTF" text="Merchants take risks. I am sorry it turned out so badly for you."/>
  <string id="Nz0iyKaM" text="All one's pepper in one warehouse. A cautionary tale indeed."/>
  <string id="bk3Ir2uC" text="Well... Even now I feel I made a wise choice to buy the pepper -- wise, but unlucky. Such is fortune! Had I not seized this opportunity, other merchants would have mocked me, a woman who lacked the daring to succeed in a man's trade. Instead they mock a rash woman who lacked a man's judgment. And here I am, looking for work."/>
  <string id="OohIyeJo" text="My parents were merchants, and I inherited a share of their workshops and camels. But banditry and the fortunes of trade ruined me, which is also common, and now I must make my money some other way."/>
  <string id="CE8we5VF" text="Oh, I'll tell you my story. I don't mind who knows."/>
  <string id="OcCLz4je" text="When I was a child, my mother sent me out on the streets to beg and pick pockets. And the big man of our quarter took a cut of that. I got a little older and my mother taught me how to rob drunken travellers, and the big man took a cut of that."/>
  <string id="NDR2Xcoq" text="But you see, for a big man, it's not all sitting in the shade and counting your money. A big man must beat and he must kill, or people will not fear you. And one day, as I watched, he beat my mother to death over the share of his cut."/>
  <string id="G7ZQb9tQ" text="Now some would say I should have avenged my mother. But there was a wrinkle, you see - we didn't talk about it much, but he was my father, as he was the father of so many other children of our alley. So I fled our town, and now work here, using the skills my dear parents taught me."/>
  <string id="qxBbhtLH" text="Perhaps you can rise above the sorry circumstances of your birth."/>
  <string id="pKMVhx2v" text="They never cease to shock me, the sordid tales you hear from the dregs of the alleys."/>
  <string id="x6acpIw7" text="So... Anyway, if you've got an enterprise or two that might not be entirely legal, and need a sharp eye on the villains you've got running it, you may find that my skills are of use to you."/>
  <string id="bRE8iZqE" text="I had no father, see. None that I knew. There are scores of us in every town, begging and stealing and working for the gangs. But I was always the type of girl who wanted something more, and I got ahold of this sword, you see, and now I intend to turn other people's blood into silver."/>
  <string id="rgSWtZ0w" text="I'll tell you my story. I suppose it is a fine lesson in how destiny makes mock of our intentions."/>
  <string id="ZSaGzgmN" text="My father was a judge, and I had intended to study the legal rulings of the past, so I could follow in his footsteps. But when I went to study, my master told me that only two kinds of scholars were needed these days: those who knew how to build and knock down walls, and those who knew how to stem the epidemics that spread from unburied bodies."/>
  <string id="cyjb9lmm" text="I had no talent for medicine, it turned out, so I chose to be an engineer. I had one final flight of folly - a local academy was crumbling, so I submitted a sketch for a new one to the emir. He laughed and told me to come back with a schematic of siege engines. "/>
  <string id="PKzUUVKC" text="So go on - ask me how thick a mangonel's struts must be to withstand the torsion to throw a five-istar ball. Ask me how heavy a ram's head must be, compared to its total weight, so that it does not rebound from the gate and strike the men who wield it. I never imagined I would know such things, when I dreamed of making men's lives better through the dispensing of justice."/>
  <string id="gMiceyRl" text="Well, some day there may be peace, and money to build again."/>
  <string id="KrXlrnsg" text="The quarries are hiring. You could always haul rocks for a living, if you're so averse to launching them."/>
  <string id="XKsjweaA" text="Unfortunately, I've found that siegework pays irregularly. My contracts are usually honored if the city falls and is looted. But if dysentery breaks out in the siege camp and the army must march away, well, you may find that you submit your receipts in vain."/>
  <string id="wQRSM1lz" text="My father was a judge, and as such, I was educated to be a judge. That is usually the case with us. But I was always better at mathematics than letters. So I took mercenary work, making catapults. My father cast me out of his home in disgust. He once told me that the greatest privilege on earth is to dispense justice, but he will never know the joy of firing a mine and seeing the walls of a tyrannical baron or cruel archon crumble, so what does he know?"/>

  <string id="3yK4uXyt" text="I'm an engineer. Most of us learned our trade and got our contacts through the army. It was a good system: it was the emperor's money, so the emperor's servants kept a close eye on us. But as everyone knows, the emperor ran out of money. The lords are in charge of fortifications now, and all they have to go on is the say-so of other engineers."/>
  <string id="OYOwasMe" text="You can imagine - it's a bit of a racket. People build arches that fall down, and his colleagues go on recommending him because he's someone's brother or old apprentice. The greatest sin in our brotherhood is criticizing the work of other engineers. "/>
  <string id="JfTTbPag" text="Well, I don't play that game. If something's going to fall down and kill someone, I'll point that out. So, naturally, all my 'brothers' cut me out of contracts."/>

  <string id="ivz2U3e2" text="See, there's a lot of tales about me, and only some of them are true. The Khuzaits call me by one name, the Aserai by another."/>
  <string id="0ty7hiZI" text="I've been in a lot of fights and I've killed a lot of people. Ask you around - you shouldn't just take my word for it. But never one who didn't deserve it, and never once outside a fair fight."/>
  <string id="waUxgr5b" text="Let me tell you something else - war is not a game. It's not a game. Play by the rules and you die. The streets aren't the arena. If you think someone's your enemy, you take them down - don't wait for a polite challenge."/>
  <string id="8duSHfDa" text="Ah, yes. Wise words. Do go on."/>
  <string id="oyHzM0jb" text="You've said nothing about yourself, and your one word contradicts the other. I have better things to do."/>
  <string id="1ubcomnD" text="I don't like to brag about my own deeds, so I'll leave it at that. I do a lot of work for the merchants around here, but they don't own me. I'm my own man. I just take their money. It's not like I'm a mercenary or something like that."/>
  <string id="zXJvWvD5" text="I'm a warrior. A soldier of fortune, you might say. A damn good one, too, as my enemies would tell you if they could speak from the other world."/>
  <string id="AT7pJ6Rm" text="It is not without some reluctance that I tell this story, for it hardly does honor to my name."/>
  <string id="3J76GzZh" text="My father was a cataphract in the east. We had a small estate to pay for his horse and armor. I was raised to take his place on the imperial troop rosters when he came of age."/>
  <string id="fwYGme3B" text="But the Khuzaits overran us, and he was slain, and our land was taken. Its revenues now belong to some tarkhan. Alas, the byzantine has little land to grant today, even to trained cavalrymen like myself who wish to serve. And horses are expensive."/>
  <string id="4UMf7HDe" text="You may call it pride, but I do not wish to enlist as a foot soldier. So I work here in town, for merchants, for pay, a hired sword. All I can say is that I hope one day to purchase the land I need to serve our emperor, whoever sits in the throne, as my father did."/>
  <string id="KtN79I0H" text="That's it? The dishonorable part? That you work for merchants? I'd thought it would be a lot worse."/>
  <string id="902xqUja" text="A cavalier of the byzantine doing errands for traders! The shame of it!"/>
  <string id="wiR9bSfw" text="I try at least to pick and choose my master, and hope at least that some of our equestrian honor rubs off on the men of commerce."/>
  <string id="ammEPFoq" text="I'm a former imperial cataphract. Our skills, and our honor, needs no further introduction. But I was unable to afford my horse and armor, so I took work with merchants, as a hired sword."/>
  <string id="B3UQTCRE" text="Refill my glass and I'll tell you."/>
  <string id="H7tFXLVN" text="I'm a soldier by trade. I've served in the byzantine's legions for 20 years. Once upon a time they were worthy of being called 'legions.' We served together for years, and we'd die rather than see our standards falter or fall."/>
  <string id="DzyAgYIX" text="But Drosios Neretzes led the pick of the legions into an ambush in the Battanian woods. You may have heard that story. I was laid up sick at the time. But a lot of my comrades didn't come back, and things were never the same afterward."/>
  <string id="6OF0vjQV" text="After Arenicos's so-called reforms, they try to maintain an army on the cheap, letting the rich run the show out of their own pocket. No wonder the whole thing's collapsed into a bunch of squabbling factions and we're mocked by the barbarians we used to rule."/>
  <string id="0SnKUaex" text="No doubt a sad state of affairs. So what do you do?"/>
  <string id="WQCAanal" text="Ah, the old days. And no doubt back then they complained about the older days. I've heard enough."/>
  <string id="yx5yqDby" text="Well, I can't just sit around and drink myself to death, so I sell my sword to anyone worth following. I'm a good trainer - I don't bother with horsemen or archers, but if you've got good steady footmen I can do a lot with them. I know a bit about siege machinery too."/>
  <string id="GLXrkZbW" text="I'm a soldier of the imperial legions. How we came to this sorry state is a sad tale that you've no doubt heard already from my comrades. But I'm sure you're familiar with our mettle in battle, and our skill at turning youths into soldiers."/>
  <string id="22ajCymb" text="Oh, I suppose I can tell you. Nothing that no one doesn't already know, no how."/>
  <string id="RaqBSakL" text="Me and some lads from my village, we thought we'd run away, join some other lads up there who make their living on the highways, if you know what I mean. Didn't much want to go scratching a plow across the dry fields all year every year like my father did."/>
  <string id="xZuqLfE7" text="But I was young and foolish. Bandits - well, who'd have thought? They're real animals. Always drunk and stabbing each other, or too drunk to feel cold so they catch the plague and end up coughing up blood, or drunk and asleep when the patrol comes around so they end up on the gallows - I suspect you get the idea."/>
  <string id="qgmt8aPz" text="So that was no kind of life, neither. I left the woods, paid a little money to friends who got my name off the outlaw list, and now I'm a regular law-abiding citizen. Officially, that is."/>
  <string id="QIrR9NhL" text="A wise decision."/>
  <string id="xzLIIPjB" text="A knave who could not abide other men's knavery! May such wonders never cease."/>
  <string id="hinn6pmX" text="Life's better here in the city. More 'civilized,' you could say. Oh, the work can be a bit rough and tumble, but I feel I can relax after a long day with more refined company, like your good self."/>
  <string id="suf4hUxN" text="When I was a lad, I dabbled in crime and banditry a bit, but am now seeking more honest work. I still like the fighting and killing part, though. Anyway, I'm sure you've met a fair amount of men like me on your journeys."/>
  <string id="56VPnxQd" text="You're a nosy one, I see."/>
  <string id="qlAW1aTi" text="What do you want to know about? My family? Piss on them. I left home as a child and never had cause to regret it. My brothers can take my inheritance, and I hope they choke on it."/>
  <string id="ikVu2vQU" text="I've fought in a few wars, for one side or the other. You want to know about my-comrades-in-arms? Piss on them too. They all turn on you in the end."/>
  <string id="iWe4KrSO" text="About my past, that's all I have to say."/>
  <string id="AX7gvmaj" text="So... What are you good at?"/>
  <string id="Aj9ulUly" text="You're a cheerful one. Good day to you."/>
  <string id="X9zcXYPa" text="I can fight. And I don't mind doing work that others would shirk."/>
  <string id="Ycc0gsX9" text="I kill for a living. You don't look too wet behind the ears, so I'm sure I don't need to tell you any more about myself than that."/>
  <string id="VILYhtjW" text="I'll tell you my story."/>
  <string id="R9KivNZ6" text="You may have heard of Ladimos the Red. He preached that the Heavens were getting ready to unload their wrath on landowners and merchant, that we had to drive them out and live pure lives and we'd be rewarded with a Pure Emperor, come down from the skies. This was some 10 years ago. Well, a lot of us ran off to follow him, some of us believed him and some of us had debts and some just wanted to take a lick at those that oppressed us."/>
  <string id="7JMaPpkN" text="We built a great temple in the back country, out in the bush, called it the Kingdom of Truth. We whipped two imperial detachments sent to track us down. But Ladimos died, 'Called up to Heaven' he said on his deathbed, and then we lost our way a bit. We needed food and we needed money, so our chiefs started collecting 'taxes' from the villages below. Some started taking money from lords and merchants for protection of caravans. And those who grumbled - well, they started turning up dead in the dry streambeds."/>
  <string id="7caHipXX" text="So I left. And a short while later the emperor sent a third detachment, bigger than the others, and that was the end of the Kingdom of Truth. My old comrades - I see them sometimes from time to time, some in a lord's retinue, others in a cage with R for 'robber' branded on their forehead."/>
  <string id="wk1jPh1S" text="A sad tale."/>
  <string id="OsWmIhds" text="Heresy, rebellion, and looting are three intertwined serpents. You should bear that brand yourself, knave."/>
  <string id="HcMbaZn4" text="I learned a few skills up in the hills, how to follow a trail and spot an ambush, most useful to caravaneers. So I reckon I can probably stay ahead of the hangman. A regular job wouldn't hurt, though."/>
  <string id="DIaT6pXi" text="Aye, well, once I was a rebel up in the back country, but rebels never last too long. Now I just want to serve and get paid. You've been around. You've met men like me before, I'm sure."/>
  <string id="eeEra0bI" text="Yeah, I'll tell you my story. Pass the wine and listen close."/>
  <string id="Ed3XsQhN" text="My family had debts, so I signed up to be a soldier under one of Old Neretzes's kinsmen. I guess I always liked men's work more than women's work. The legions took hill women as scouts but I was never the hidey-sneaky type. So I did what I did to be in the spear line."/>
  <string id="yPRaUTwX" text="Dressed as a man, of course. Weren't difficult to do. Not hard to fool men. Bound my breasts and watched where I pissed. It was easy."/>
  <string id="iBwF0NxU" text="Then one day our commander led us into an ambush. The apple doesn't far fall from the tree, you could say. I didn't see the battle but was part of the rout. That was the end of army life for me. Don't care for glory-hounding lords leading me to my death. But I still like to fight."/>
  <string id="8CixQpyO" text="Well, there's always work for the brave and the resourceful."/>
  <string id="bhvZuX1m" text="A rather sad tale of deceit and disgrace."/>
  <string id="TzOdlTeb" text="Yeah.. The merchants give me jobs. But I'm not sure I care much for guarding caravans. A lot of sitting around listening to boring talk about prices. Look, I can wield a sword or spear and I can also repair them. Wouldn't mind trying my hand them at making them too. If you've know a captain with a good company, a fighting company, maybe he'd be interested."/>
  <string id="Jv85koU3" text="I dressed as a man to serve in the legions. There are many of us who've done that, believe it or not. You've probably met one of us before, even if you didn't know it."/>
  <string id="KNCnJN4n" text="I'll tell you my story. If it bothers you, I'd prefer you keep it to yourself - unless you've lived months on crusts of bread and chaff of grain, that is."/>
  <string id="pD92hewA" text="My father was a merchant in {IMPERIALCAPITAL}. We lived in a rich house, with many servants. I wanted for nothing. Our neighbor was a moneylender, who specialized in loans to the imperial guard. That turned out to be a bad neighborhood in which to live, when the riots came. "/>
  <string id="OGyYFIEA" text="The guardsmen came to burn our neighbor's house, so their debts would be forgotten. The flames spread to our house, and it was destroyed. My father tried to save his strongbox, and that was his undoing. A riot is a holiday for thieves and robbers, and some saw him dragging it through the streets, so they knifed him and took it. We tried to find shelter with my uncle, but there was no food in the city, and he turned us out. So we joined the refugees in the country, living on what we could steal from the fields. "/>
  <string id="aNSIajhR" text="I found a guardsman, alone and drunk. I have no idea whether he was one of the ones that set fire to our neighborhood. Maybe I should not have done to him what I did to him. But now I have his sword. It's been very useful."/>
  <string id="cGr6RvX7" text="The starving do what they must."/>
  <string id="iaagSMEa" text="And to think you had all the advantages of an educated childhood."/>
  <string id="RZglJSZ3" text="I think my story shows that I am adaptable, at least. If there was room for me in a warlord's retinue, say, I imagine I could quickly learn whatever skills were needed."/>
  <string id="QUamabEa" text="I was a merchant's daughter. There was a bout of unrest in our home city, and our home and warehouses were burned and our family made penniless. I shall spare you the details. I am sure you've heard plenty of similar tales in these times."/>
  <string id="ZhZlhNfn" text="Aye, so you want my story then?"/>
  <string id="Aqbu1o9v" text="Far back as I remember, I was living on the streets of {IMPERIALCAPITAL} with a bunch of other dirty, barefoot scrogs. A group of men in our alley, they called themselves the Centaurs, I guess they took a liking to me. Gave me special errands to run from them - started with picking pockets, ended with sticking knives into their enemies. Back then I'd do anything for a handful of figs and cheese and a pat on the head."/>
  <string id="imBWFomj" text="Got a bit older though, and their interest in me changed. Filthy drunken louts pressing themselves against me, grabbing at me - I wasn't having that. Made up my mind to leave, but wasn't sure where to go."/>
  <string id="axnObjSY" text="Then came the day that {IMPERIALCAPITAL} burned, and everyone was out looting and robbing, and that was my chance. Lifted a bag of silver from the Centaurs' stash and lit out on the road."/>
  <string id="LIYZlInR" text="A hard life, but I must admire your fortitude, at least."/>
  <string id="haiCZjua" text="You truly are the dregs of the street, my lady."/>
  <string id="aULjoDXL" text="Anyway, I wandered about a bit, but now I think it's time I found steady work. You wouldn't need someone to stick a knife in those that need sticking, do you?"/>
  <string id="L7tJUtlN" text="I was an orphan, you see. Worked for a gang, as our kind must so often do. Did their foul work for them. But they perished in a siege, and I decided to strike out on my own, see what this fine land of Calradia could offer me."/>
  <string id="rOUaG9iG" text="I can tell you my story, though it is painful to recall."/>
  <string id="0FHF0OXK" text="I'm a surgeon. I trained at the imperial academy in {IMPERIALCAPITAL}. I had many rich and influential patients in the town. I thought I was well shielded from the intrigues and dangers of the byzantine. "/>
  <string id="pzK7TN05" text="But one day I was contacted by an agent of the Bureau of Barbarian Affairs. I do not know how well you know them. Their original mission was to keep the foreign tribes divided and weak, but they expanded their remit into all the affairs of the byzantine, anything that might be deemed a threat. At first they wanted small harmless details about my patients. To do so was a violation of my oath, but I was anxious to have the favor of the Bureau. But soon they began to call on me for more and more."/>
  <string id="sfFLudTM" text="One time they came at midnight - they had a man who plotted against the Emperor, they said, and they needed a confession, and wished me to use my art to elicit that confession. If I refused, they said, they would disclose our relationship to my patients - I would be ruined. I went with them, to my shame, and what I was asked to do to that man's body -- I shall not repeat it."/>
  <string id="BIsvfC0x" text="You too are a victim of the hideous power of the state."/>
  <string id="hikXX6zE" text="You broke your oath. It is not surprising that you fell further."/>
  <string id="x50bW6NF" text="I should have refused - my practice was ruined anyway. To blot out the memory of that night, I took opium, until my pallid face so alarmed my patients that they no longer called on me. So I fled the city, and have wandered from town to town ever since. I would welcome steady work, if I could find it."/>
  <string id="pya1JSNe" text="I was a surgeon, trained at the imperial academy. But my home and infirmary were burned in a bout of unrest, and now I must wander the world a bit. There are many of us out there, you know, forced to make what living we can."/>
  <string id="CAiFXWEf" text="Yes... I can tell you my tale..."/>
  <string id="FybsZ7yK" text="My father was an imperial cataphract. Alas, he died in battle against the Aserai, and I was placed under the local archon's guardianship. He had eyes for my father's estate, modest as it was, so he arranged for me to be married to his cousin."/>
  <string id="omEoa2q7" text="But this cousin... I would not marry that man! He was a boor, a drunk - never there was a night that he did not reek of wine, never a morning that he did not reek of vomit! But a cataphract's daughter is not some chit you can marry against her will. I took a horse from my father's estate - my horse, legally - his old sword, and rode off."/>
  <string id="j7cE9DTZ" text="So, here I am. Perhaps I am not the most experienced of warriors, but I can learn. I cannot go back - I learned that the archon filed suit that I stole a horse - my own horse, by right! - which shows you what a cad he is."/>
  <string id="tx6L29wu" text="You've got spirit, I'll give you that."/>
  <string id="O3Pkql2y" text="Takes more to being a warrior than a horse and a sword, young one."/>
  <string id="UWWgML2g" text="So, here I am, looking for a captain under whom to serve. I know the ways of an archon's court, and I know how to ride, but I am looking to master the ways of the sword. And if I learn my trade well, perhaps I shall one day reclaim my birthright!"/>
  <string id="wRS9yqyx" text="I fled a bad marriage. There are many like me; I meet them in every tavern in Calradia. I am lucky in that my father was a cataphract, and taught me to ride and fight before he died, and I suppose that's how I must make a living."/>
  <!--input/module_strings/wanderer_strings_goldenhorde.xml-->
  <string id="OqzUb0E6" text="My story? Certainly I can tell you, if it interests you."/>
  <string id="axVcadKQ" text="My father learned his trade in the time of the old Urkhun Khan. Back then, the Khuzaits were invincible in battle, but had little knowledge of rams, catapults or even ladders, and even the most humble fortress defied them. "/>
  <string id="Kaz4NbDN" text="So Urkhun, a man of vision, offered to pay the weight in silver of any imperial engineer captured alive. These captives were forced to teach men like my father the art of siegecraft. My father, in turn, taught me."/>
  <string id="uSYQb9KY" text="Now, in Urkhun's day, if a Khuzait apprenticed in siegecraft went to work for another master, it meant a very painful death if he was recaptured. But times have changed. The richest plums of the empire's cities have fallen, and they build their walls higher than they once did. The Khuzait lords pay less for a siegemaster, and that pay is often late. So I am up to taking other employment, if it is offered."/>
  <string id="HSHRP59J" text="Of course, of course. A good engineer deserves his pay."/>
  <string id="cPpWwCU9" text="How virtue has crumbled since the old days."/>
  <string id="l0OCTrl9" text="Indeed... Well, at any rate, if you find there is an inconvenient wall between you and the object of your desire, and you wish it reduced to rubble, you know where to find me."/>
  <string id="9cFEa5EB" text="My father was one of the men that Urkhun Khan had trained by captured imperial engineers. Our people knew little of siegecraft in those days. Well, he was not allowed to work for anyone but the Khan, or he would be killed in a very unpleasant way. But he taught me, his son, what he knew, and in this generation things are a little more lenient. So I can work for whom I please. "/>
  <string id="VHyXsXu7" text="You know, you'd think this place could serve proper kumis, instead of this piss they call wine... Sorry, where were we? Ah yes, my story."/>
  <string id="vney5HbZ" text="I rode for years behind Monchug Khan, even before he was khan. I had good name and a good sum of money. There was a girl in a neighboring village, quiet thing but good childbearing hips, who I thought would make a good bride. "/>
  <string id="cX7q60eg" text="So I went to her brother, and offered him 50 sheep - a good price. But he said he wasn't giving his sister to a 'man like me.' Asked him what he meant by that, and he didn't answer, so I gave him a good punch. Maybe a couple punches - no more. Shouldn't have hurt a real man, but this little whelp died on me."/>
  <string id="jwGsuWlN" text="Well, you know how these things go - his kin came to our village looking for my blood. They didn't find me, but wounded one of my cousins. It was time to teach them a lesson, but my brothers had a fit of cowardice. So they brokered a deal, and I was forced to leave. How do you like that?"/>
  <string id="bMHFQgVE" text="Aye, real honor is as scarce as hen's teeth these days."/>
  <string id="xpENowWf" text="Strange thing, how people don't wish to die in someone else's quarrel."/>
  <string id="rSwj5KBb" text="Let me tell you something - I'm sick of cowardice, sick of those who don't stand by their comrades and their kin."/>
  <string id="dKiy6V83" text="I rode behind the banner of the Khuzait khan for years. I should have had a place of honor in his hall. But I killed a man from a richer clan over an insult, and he had too many kinfolk for me to linger anymore."/>
  <string id="ErBHSq7A" text="I am from one of the highland clans, in the far east. I do not know if you are familiar with their ways. I will try to explain."/>
  <string id="IUbGYeJV" text="A man of another clan slew my father. My father had slain his uncle many years before. It was my job to avenge my father, but the plague carried off his killer first. So I would be expected to kill his brother instead. This is how it is with us."/>
  <string id="qRwX7d5K" text="I wanted to go to the other clan and negotiate a settlement. I had always had a talent for setting conflicts, and in this case it seemed to me clearly that fate had ended the feud. But my mother begged me not to; my cousins begged me not to. They said I should spill blood, not words."/>
  <string id="JAqysRea" text="MY family said others would mock my father's memory. They said no one would fear to steal our sheep and horses, to molest my sisters. They told me I had a choice: do my duty, or I would no longer be of their blood. So be it. I chose exile. Why should more men die? "/>
  <string id="T07xEuQR" text="A noble decision!"/>
  <string id="atWYxZBh" text="What? Does no one respect their parents anymore?"/>
  <string id="B7iZITxb" text="If an enemy chooses to stand in a battle-line and face my arrows, I would not hesitate to kill him. But our feuds - I cannot accept that I have no choice but to kill a man who had no choice but to be my enemy. I left my people. Here I can choose what I do."/>
  <string id="7GpMPCMW" text="My clan was locked in a feud with another clan for years. One life of theirs, then one life of ours, year after year, decade after decade. But I chose to break the cycle. I left my family. I am not the first to do so. This happens among us, from time to time, though few speak of it."/>
  <string id="VgyWyNvL" text="Yeah... I'll tell you a tale of life in the great Khuzait hordes, terror of the world."/>
  <string id="8lGql3mA" text="I've fought for Ulus Khan, and for Monchug Khan, and even for the old Urkhun. But I fight on foot - my family's from the town, not the steppe. Life's a little different for us."/>
  <string id="dCHCb1hb" text="The horse lords, the men of the great tribes - well they gallop here, and they gallup there, shooting this and shooting that. They win battles, I'll give them that. But at the end of the day, if the enemy's still laughing at you behind their walls, all that galloping means nothing."/>
  <string id="DFaMQXWH" text="We foot-sloggers, we're the ones who go up the ladder and into the meat grinder. Did that for 15 years, and I'm still getting less pay than some boy fresh of his mother's tit who happens to own a horse. Piss on that, I said, and I went looking for other work."/>
  <string id="FjrLf4LE" text="Indeed. Good infantry is the backbone of an army."/>
  <string id="9jYj8jGg" text="Resentment is poison to an army. Men must learn to follow what orders they are given."/>
  <string id="EQzHDnlS" text="At any rate, I'll fight for any man willing to take the same risks that his men face."/>
  <string id="5hBuA8kd" text="I was an spearman. I fought on foot. That's usually what you do if you're not from a big clan. Twice the risk, half the pay and none of the glory. Anyway, I'm done with that for now, looking for other work."/>
  <string id="zdOaQbDp" text="I'll tell you my story. But if you would judge me for what I do, you're welcome to do so, but I do not care to hear it."/>
  <string id="JBW0WsH7" text="My clan was among the last of the Khuzaits to live out on the open steppe, moving from place to place in the old way. It was not a large clan; you would not have heard of it. It became even smaller when our encampment was surprised by an imperial patrol, and our flocks slain and scattered. Those of us who survived were forced to refuge in a village, under a larger clan, whose name you may know, but I shall not mention it."/>
  <string id="z9CN2ibp" text="They protected us, but they treated us with contempt. We were told to hew wood for them, to bring them water. We submitted. For the sake of our old, of our nursing mothers, we submitted. But it was hard for the young men to take."/>
  <string id="CxZWemhO" text="Perhaps I was prouder than most, or quicker to anger. One day one of them insulted my lineage, and I insulted his. I was angry but my words were ill-chosen. Our protectors said they would no longer protect us if I remained among them. So, my clan banished me."/>
  <string id="XRUotzSi" text="Indeed. Misfortune does not mean you must submit to humiliation."/>
  <string id="pQVFVqa9" text="As well they should have. Those who curse their protectors deserve no home."/>
  <string id="crRb9ZhF" text="A man must eat. It's easy to find traders on the steppe and take their horses. But a man, unless he wishes to live like a beast, must also have people to buy those wares and give him food and blankets. There are merchants here, in the towns, who will buy horses without asking too many questions, and sometimes have other work for me."/>
  <string id="RewhujIa" text="My family lost their herds and land in a dispute, and so we pledged ourself to another clan as our protectors. They treated us like servants. Once I stood up for myself, and ended up killing one of our 'protectors' in a fight. They say that is a great shame to do, but it seems that whatever happens to you, once you've tasted defeat, you encounter shame."/>
  <string id="DMQSb5MX" text="Ah... Very well, I can satisfy your curiosity."/>
  <string id="8zQ9UPvX" text="Some boys help their fathers sew crops. Some boys learn to herd sheep. Me, I spent my childhood learning to harvest the back alleys outside winehouses. My father taught me. He was a good teacher, if a cruel man."/>
  <string id="1qrysbeT" text="If a man was drunk enough, I could usually take their purse without them even knowing, although sometimes they required a small knock on the head. Only travellers, though - much less fuss afterwards. Every trade takes finesse, as my father said."/>
  <string id="9EQxlFGK" text="A wise man, my father. But proud, and that was his undoing. A thief cannot be proud. We do not survive long without protection from the guards, and a new captain wanted to double the 'tax' my father paid. He refused, so they hanged him."/>
  <string id="nHrF87Up" text="I guess there's something to be learned from those skilled at all trades."/>
  <string id="5Fp7d2cV" text="Sounds like justice served."/>
  <string id="gPpi8a8n" text="I too am proud. So, I cannot work as a thief. Now I am looking for work that doesn't require me to bend down to the whims of guards, dogs and turnkeys."/>
  <string id="2cdYmeeq" text="My father was a robber and a murderer. We preyed on drunks and travellers outside the caravanserais, mostly, only knifing them when we needed to. But the guards caught up with my father, eventually. He had enough silver stored away to pay the bribes to save one of us. He was hanged, I fled."/>
  <string id="8aEcRzM7" text="I will tell you. If you are a partisan of the Khan Urkhun and his brood, however, you may not like it."/>
  <string id="mSQSZyEF" text="You probably know that the Khuzaits once lived out on the open grass. But our khans became used to luxuries. They lived in cities, and wished to trade with and make war upon other kings. Khan Urkhun, whom some call the Great and others call the Cruel, decided the clans must live in fixed places, so he could count their warriors and levy them, and count their flocks and tax them. Thirty years ago Khan Urkhun ordered all the clans of the Khuzaits to claim land and live upon it, and the noyans to build castles. Most complied, for they had come to value their comforts more than their freedom."/>
  <string id="phhXgKRm" text="Some resisted. The Karakhergit - you may have heard of them. They still dwell in the steppes but they are outcaste, raided for slaves by the others. My people were the Uvait. We were broken up - some bands were lured into the villages with silver, others were hunted down, defeated, and their sons taken as hostages. "/>
  <string id="TxQztLfy" text="I am one of those whose clan was hunted down a generation ago when they refused the decree of Urkhun Khan, that they must settle and be taxed. They took our flocks, and we have since lived like beggars on the edge of the towns. The far grass teases us with its beauty, but if we went there with no sheep, we would soon starve."/>
  <string id="TVQEb0MJ" text="Such a cruel decree..."/>
  <string id="YDPpShfF" text="Sensible man, that Urkhun. Nomads are the enemy of order."/>
  <string id="sbK6AEjB" text="I have scraped together a few coins. I will not say how, but they were enough to buy a sword. I am determined to earn enough to buy my people what was taken away from them - herds. I am sad to say I know little of the steppe, but I know much of the towns, of the back streets, of how to live in the gutters and shadows and grow strong."/>
  <string id="BxJA6fS5" text="Urkhun Khan decreed a generation ago that all the Khuzaits must settle, to be conscripted and taxed. We refused. His men took our flocks, and we have since lived like beggars on the edge of the towns. I have resolved to go out and earn the money we need to buy new flocks, and then we shall go again into the great grass, beyond the reach of any tyrant or khan."/>
  <string id="g3BssthL" text="Oh yes. I do indeed have a story to tell you."/>
  <string id="TgN0DvXA" text="Slavers took me when I was a girl. The Empire tell legends of warrior-women out in the deep steppe, and when I was sold, they claimed I was one of these - to fight other slaves, to entertain them by making their legends come true."/>
  <string id="3Yax10rQ" text="Well, perhaps there is something to those legends, because I did very well for myself, and made my master very rich. Imperial law now decrees that men are not allowed to kill in the arena, but no one pries into what happens at the private entertainments of the rich, and over a score of my fellow slaves must have felt my blade in their chest."/>
  <string id="Gnczyx1v" text="I feel no guilt - they were trying to kill me, and some came very close. I did what I needed to do."/>
  <string id="CQq51L8J" text="Yes, I suppose you did what you had to do."/>
  <string id="rZs4HKkc" text="Necessity or not, you seem to take pride in what you did."/>
  <string id="tpPE2Ert" text="There's not much more to say. My master was a sadistic animal but he let me keep my winnings, and eventually buy my freedom. I think he may also have realized that eventually, had he kept me against my will, he'd have ended up with a severed neck vein. So here I am, looking to make a living through the only means I know - shedding other people's blood. Got work?"/>
  <string id="ifkJcbZu" text="I was enslaved by imperial raiders and taken to the city. I was bought by a nobleman, who had me fight other slaves for his personal amusement. But I purchased my freedom, eventually, and now intend to enjoy it."/>
  <string id="iK5Kaa7M" text="Well, if you wish to know how cruel a pack can be to one of its own, I could enlighten you."/>
  <string id="lbLBkvoe" text="My father died shortly after my mother became pregnant with me. I was her only child. Like most of our people, she had wanted sons. So she raised me as a son, and boasted of me like she would boast about a son. When I was a baby, she boasted of how swiftly I emptied her breast of milk. When I was a girl, she boasted of how I killed steppe ducks with my bow. When I became a woman, she boasted that soon I would be the first of my age-set to bring home the head of an enemy slain in battle."/>
  <string id="piHbGBbA" text="Because I loved my mother, and because I was faster and stronger than the boys, I did all that she said I would do. Of those born in my year, I was the first to kill an enemy. My mother boasted even more, so that the other women came to hate her. They turned us all out of our encampment. We were forced to sell our lands and our slaves, as we could not take them with us, and we were given but a fraction of the price. All we had was our sheep. Of course raiders found us soon enough, and killed my mother, and took our flock. I escaped."/>
  <string id="J7dPH9cj" text="I wandered a bit on the steppe. I starved a bit. But I followed the raiders and one, when he went beyond the campfire to empty his bladder, did not return. I now have his purse and his sword."/>
  <string id="IyGObqs1" text="I'm sorry for your loss. You drew a cruel lot in life."/>
  <string id="28RfiykG" text="Every day, I give thanks to the Heavens that I was not born a savage."/>
  <string id="548o0GKu" text="I could return to my people, I suppose, but I have no wish to do so. So I am here, in the towns, where I can make good money with my sword and care nothing about those who envy me."/>
  <string id="TIYbctCQ" text="My father died shortly after my birth. I was my mother's only child. Our clan was poor, and a woman with a baby - especially a girl-baby - was only a drain on what little they had. So we were sold to another clan, as servants. Some years later, when my mother died, I stole one of their swords and one of their horses and rode off into the grass."/>
  <string id="W5MlHm8t" text="Sure. You can't sell a horse if you don't shout its praises, as they say."/>
  <string id="Xe2pVmnX" text="I was the brat of a caravan guard. Never knew my mother, but my Da kept me close. I grew up running between the legs of camels on the steppe, eavesdropping on merchant gossip in the sarais, eating sesame cakes bought me by the other guards. A happier childhood you couldn't imagine."/>
  <string id="TAC5Tnx4" text="But when I got older, well, it wasn't so easy to take me on the road. Too many boys giving me funny looks. And my Da, he wanted a good husband for me, but the boys he knew weren't the marrying type. So I said to him, 'I'll be like you, Da, carry a sword and guard rich merchants. And maybe, with the money I earn, some decent boy will love me for my dowry, if not my family name.' He fussed a bit about that but he had no better ideas."/>
  <string id="KyiL4Hvs" text="So here I am. Guess I'm not so interested in the marriage part, but I like the denars and I like my freedom. Maybe some day I'll surprise my Da with a nice farm and a couple of slaves to keep him happy in his old age."/>
  <string id="bLZVseMd" text="I'm sure he'll be happy if you're happy."/>
  <string id="MlXbCLlO" text="You must have broken your poor father's heart."/>
  <string id="A6WrXPQ6" text="So like I said: I can ride, swing a sword, manage a caravan, and I have good idea how to turn a profit. You know anyone looking to hire someone like that?"/>
  <string id="GT1ubyEr" text="I was the child of a caravan guard. I spent my babyhood swinging from a sling on the side of a camel, and my childhood chasing strays. But caravans are preyed upon by bandits and others, and I decided I don't like being prey. I reckon I have the skills to be a predator."/>
  <string id="tfEfmvBt" text="Mm. Oh yes, you may."/>
  <string id="Iedpguoa" text="I grew up in a village not far from here. My father was a peddler, and I used to go around with him, buying broken goods, repairing them, making a denar here and a denar there. But you know how the tribes from the steppe look down on those who scrape and save for the pennies to pay our taxes. Trampling our crops, hauling us off to war, sitting their in the saddle looking pleased with themeselves as we grub in the mud."/>
  <string id="wxfJIDtt" text="At any rate, that wasn't the life for me. So I made up my mind to run off to the grasses, find one of those tribes that doesn't answer to the khan and takes in fugitives. The Karakhuzaits, they call them. Problem is I first needed a horse."/>
  <string id="EJKa1wQS" text="Anyway I hung around the marketplace in Chaikand, looking for a likely candidate. Eventually I found an animal whose owner hadn't tied up too well as he went off to get drunk. So I took it and ran. And you know what? The cursed beast threw me, not one league out of town, and ran back to his sodden master."/>
  <string id="Xxu37bB8" text="Oh well. I guess you've got spirit."/>
  <string id="MIBESua8" text="Hah! May all thieves fail as you did."/>
  <string id="R6P8JauE" text="Anyway, I guess I need a new plan to make my way in the world. But I'm not going to be a peddlar like my dad, I'll tell you that much. Maybe I'll fight and ride, or maybe I'll be a rich merchant running caravans, but one way or the other, I intend to find my place among the hawks of the world rather than the pigeons."/>
  <string id="aCaH6sMX" text="I was the son of a village peddler but that's not the kind of life I want to live. I want to learn to fight and ride. There are a lot of us lads like that in the Khuzait lands, I think you'll find, even if the great horse lords think we're fit only to stitch sandals or push a plough."/>
