  <string id="L90aSR5J" text="Although the youngest of the sons of Caliph al-Mustansir Billah, al-Musta'li became caliph through the machinations of his brother-in-law, the vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah. In response, his oldest brother and main candidate for their father's succession, Nizar, rose in revolt in Alexandria, but was defeated and executed. This caused a major split in the Isma'ili movement. Many communities, especially in Persia and Iraq, split off from the officially sponsored Isma'ili hierarchy and formed their own, Nizari movement, holding Nizar and his descendants as the rightful imams. Al-Musta'li died in 1101, possibly poisoned by al-Afdal, and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, al-Amir."/>
