Founded by Darshi-speaking merchants, it made its wealth buying horses, sheep and cattle from the surrounding herding villages and sending them west to the markets of the empire in huge drives, accompanied by guards to ward off raiders from the steppes. Neither its walls nor its mercenary armies could withstand the coming of Khan Urkhun, however, who it granted to the Khergit clan in recognition of their valor."/>
