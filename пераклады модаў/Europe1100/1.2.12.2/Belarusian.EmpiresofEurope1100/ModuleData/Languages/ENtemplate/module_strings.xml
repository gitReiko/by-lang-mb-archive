  <string id="aestiandescription" text="Estonia in the 1100-1200 AD was characterized by a decentralized political landscape. The Estonian people, primarily of Finno-Ugric descent, inhabited a land of dense forests, fertile plains, and a coastline dotted with small ports. The society was organized into various tribes or clans, each led by chieftains or elders. These tribes engaged in agriculture, fishing, and trading activities, forming the backbone of the economy. The Estonians were skilled craftsmen, known for their expertise in metalwork, woodworking, and textile production. Despite their decentralized structure, the Estonian tribes often united under a common cause to defend against external threats. They faced frequent raids from neighboring powers, such as the Swedes, Danes, Russians and Germans, who sought to expand their influence into the Baltic region. By the late 12th century, the influence of Christianity began to permeate Estonia through trade and missionary activities. However, the conversion process was gradual and met with resistance from some pagan factions. Overall, Estonia in the 1100-1200 AD was a land of diverse cultures, where tribal identities intersected with emerging political dynamics, shaping the course of its history."/>

  <string id="dregoviandescription" text="The Dregoviches are originally associated with the Zarubintsy culture (3 century BC – 2 century AD). As the Ice Age progressed into the territory of modern Belarus, the Zarubinians moved to the Balkans. In the Balkans they became known as Draguvites (Drougoubitai). After the end of the Ice Age, some of the Draguvites migrated back to Belarus. But the area was already settled by other ethnicities. After the Draguvites mixed with these ethnicities, the Dregoviches were formed. Modern genetic research has confirmed this hypothesis: the Dregoviches have a 50% Balkan component. Before the 10th century Dregoviches already had their own state. The Turaŭ (Turov) Principality was formed on its basis. From the 10th century to 1158 the Turaŭ Principality was conquered by Rus. From 1158 the independence of the state was restored. But Rus constantly tried to capture Turaŭ. By the beginning of the 13th century, Turaŭ had fallen into vassal dependence on the Rus Kingdom (Galicia). To liberate themselves, the Dregoviches made an alliance with Lithuania and joined it as an autonomy. During more than 500 years in the Lithuanian state, the Dregoviches mixed with other Belarusian ethnicities and formed the Belarusian nation."/>

The Žemaitian (Samogitian) ethnos is usually represented as a separate branch of the Lithuanian ethnos. All Žemaitian principalities are located in the territory of modern Lithuania (Karšuva, Knituva, Kulenė, Šaule, Upytė). Around the 7th century, the Lithuanian language separated from the Latvian. From the second half of the 13th century, the Lithuanian state slowly began to dominate the Baltic region. The creation of the state is a response to threats from the Golden Horde, Teutonic Order and Rus. Ethnically, the Lithuanian state has been a Balto-Slavic community since the 13th century and knew at least the Baltic and Ruthenian languages. Multilingualism persisted until about the 20th century and the centralization of the education system. After centralization of the education system, the non-border regions of Lithuania forgot the Ruthenian language, and the Belarusians forgot the Baltic language. After the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Lithuanian culture was strongly influenced by Poland. As a result, the Lithuanian nobility switched to the Polish language. In 1918, during World War I, the independent state of Lithuania was proclaimed. Intellectuals began to renaissance ethnic culture. Today Lithuania is an independent state."/>

They became known as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, but some researchers believe that their ethnic roots can be traced to Central Asia. During their westward migration across the Eurasian Steppe, the Bulgar tribes absorbed other tribal groups and cultural influences in a process of ethnogenesis, including Iranic, Finnic, and Hunnic tribes. The Bulgars spoke a Turkic language, the Bulgar language of the Oghuric branch. They preserved the military titles, organization, and customs of Eurasian steppes as well as pagan shamanism and belief in the sky deity Tangra. The Bulgars became semi-sedentary during the 7th century in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, establishing the polity of Old Great Bulgaria c. 630–635, which was defeated by the Khazar Empire in 668 AD. In c. 679, Khan Asparukh conquered Scythia Minor, opening access to Moesia, and established the Danubian Bulgaria – the First Bulgarian Empire, where the Bulgars became a political and military elite. They merged subsequently with established Byzantine populations, as well as with previously settled Slavic tribes, and were eventually Slavicized, thus becoming one of the ancestors of modern Bulgarians."/>

Second, Rus as ethnos which has created the state and from which the name of the state has gone. Russian scientist Boris Rybakov has analyzed all chronicles of the Rus period and has defined on what territory the population considered itself as Rus, and on what opposed itself to Rus. These data were correlated with archaeological cultures. Initially ethnoses of Severians and Polans considered themselves as Rus. In the 13th century Volhynians and White Croats began to consider themselves as Rus. But in the 13th century Rus as a state in most of the territory of the former empire stopped to exist. In the 13th-14th centuries, the third definition of Rus starts to use widely. Rus as an Orthodox person. In the religious meaning of an Orthodox person, the term extends to the territory of modern Belarus and Russia. Later, the term changed its meaning many times and had many meanings at the same time.

  <string id="volhyniandescription" text="On the territory of modern Volhynia and Galicia in the 7-8th centuries lived the tribes of Volhynians and White Croats. In the 10th century, the region was united by the Volhynian Duchy, which was part of the Rus state. In the 11th century, the Principality of Galicia began to form on the territory of the White Croats. In 1100 the locals didn't consider themselves Ruthenians yet, they pay tribute to Rus. But after the invasion of the Golden Horde into Rus in 1240 and the collapse of this proto-empire. The ruling dynasty of Rus was able to survive on the territory of Volhynia and Galicia, then to create Ruthenian Kingdom. From this point on, the local population begins to consider themselves Ruthenians, until now. In 1349 Ruthenian Kingdom will stop to exist with death of the last member of a dynasty. In the following centuries the Ruthenians were part of different states. Nowadays the Ruthenians are part of the Ukrainian nation."/>
