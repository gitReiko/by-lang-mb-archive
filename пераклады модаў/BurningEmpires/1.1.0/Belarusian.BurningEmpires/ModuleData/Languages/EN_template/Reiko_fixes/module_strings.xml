  <string id="backstory_a_be_wanderer_wre_vegetius_str" text="I am a man of science. My primary science? Military science. My fascination with soldiery extends beyond simple plebeian adoration for procession, pomp, circumstance and the glory of conquest. War is itself a science that requires multiple ingredients to ensure maximum efficiency: training, organization, discipline, even the utilization of music is designed to keep the very soldiers in time! It seems ridiculous, but by God’s grace, it works!"/>
  <string id="backstory_b_be_wanderer_wre_vegetius_str" text="You see, I have worked with comitatenses, the Palantini, Scholae and Limitanei. I will not bore you with their names.
