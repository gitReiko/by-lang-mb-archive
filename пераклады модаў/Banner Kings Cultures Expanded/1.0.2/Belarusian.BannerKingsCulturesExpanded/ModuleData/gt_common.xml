	<string id="str_culture_description.darshi" text="{=str_culture_description.darshi.text}The Darshi are an ancient civilization that sprung by the Teyagh river and its sibling, the Nahr al-Kals. For millenia they have mastered trading far and wide, as well as farming grains and dates by the riverbanks, making use of any fertile land they could control. Their cities, built with great stone walls, withstood the raids of barbarians long before the Calradoi would pride themselves over their masonry. Currently, many of the originally northern Darshi settlements are now ruled by the Khuzait horselords, and the Darshianshahr finds itself in a defensive position."/>
	
	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.geroia" text="{=str_culture_rich_name.geroia.text}Geroiako"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.geroia" text="{=str_culture_description.geroia.text}Geroia lies in the heart of the Perassic sea, between the realms of the Calradoi and  the Nahawasi. Long since separated from the Calradoi, the Geroians have leveraged their position to exerce hegemony over the sea trade. For centuries they have supplied the Calradoi with ships and slaves, and profitted over the rich sea trade. Their cities, formerly independent republics, are binded together by their Archduke. Nevertheless, the duke's seat is not hereditary, and the Geroians still choose amongst themselves who to lead them."/>
	
	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.siri" text="{=str_culture_rich_name.siri.text}Siri"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.siri" text="{=str_culture_description.siri.text}An ancient civilization born by the Aman river, known to the Nahawasi as Damar. The Siri, blessed by the fertility of the Aman, have mastered farming grain, dates and papyrus by the riverbanks such that their realm has great food abundance, despite being in the very core of the Nahasa desert. Unlike most cultures, they have organized themselves in a matriarchal system: women are supposed to lead families, and often a Siri queen leads the realm. Women also participate in war, though only as expert archers, with the men responsible for the brutality of melee. Many say only the Battaneid are a match for the Siri in terms of bowmanship."/>
	
	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.vakken" text="{=bHh03ob0}Vakken"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.vakken" text="{=str_culture_description.vakken.text}The Vakken are tribes natural to the Ircaran Wildlands, close by the Kachyar peninsula. Long ago, the Vakken and the Sturgians were closer kin. Though they increasingly distanced themselves, both tribes remained binded by their geography and faiths, which still share ancient traits. Unlike the Sturgians, however, the Vakken have never organized themselves in a kingdom. Their tribes scattered along the northern forests, all the way to the Karakaz river. The strongest tribes have built themselves forest-forts, but most Vakken still live by their tribe, deep in the woods. The woodland is their home, and sacred to their faith. No one can match the Vakken in hunting or foresting."/>
		
	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.nord" text="{=str_culture_rich_name.nord.text}Jumne"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.nord" text="{=str_culture_description.nord.text}The Jumne hail from a continent north of Calradia. Masters of the longship, they have long since reached Calradia in independent incursions, be them for trading, settling or pillaging. Most of their influence has been on the northern shores, largely in contact with the Sturgian and Vakken tribes. Many Sturgian dynasties can trace their origins to Jumne adventurers, such as the Gundaroving themselves. The saga of the Jumne has not yet finished, for there is still land to settle and kingdoms to pillage..."/>
	
	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.massa" text="{=str_culture_rich_name.massa.text}Massa"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.massa" text="{=str_culture_description.massa.text}The Massa are one of the many Wilunding tribes, known to the Calradoi as Vlandians, that came from west-over-seas. Like their Wilunding kin, they migrated to Calradia in search of greener, more bountiful land. However, they were not accepted by their kin, and instead forced to fend for themselves. The Massa gathered in their last great migration, and rode the sea southwards, to a densely wooded peninsula they call Niuja Landa. A land ripe with both fruit and disease, inhabited by beasts and the Widugauja - native tribes with no kingdom to speak of."/>


	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.balion" text="{=str_culture_rich_name.balion.text}Balion"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.balion" text="{=str_culture_description.balion.text}Balion is the land from whence the Wilunding came: the kingdom of west-over-seas. Many Wilunding tribes left their home for the prospect of more bountiful land, leaving much of Balion uninhabited. However, the Island-Kingdom still reaches Calradia through trade connections and occasional adventurers."/>
	
	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.bragantia" text="{=str_culture_rich_name.bragantia.text}Biscanja"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.bragantia" text="{=str_culture_description.bragantia.text}The Biscan Isles have long been colonized by the Calradoi, not long after the founding of Charasea. In the height of the Empire's wealth and decadence, Calradoi aristocrats would cruise around the isles on pleasure-boats, and build private villas by the picturesque, cliffy shores. Brigantia was the center of the Isles' commerce, shipping fine wines, olives and products from west-over-seas, as well as a hotspot for northern furs and hides to be distributed in all directions. Common folk at the isles lived in relative peace, if not for the Jumne raiders when the Empire could not afford to patrol its shores, and mostly raised local cattle on the lush, grassy hills. With the Advent of the Wilunding, Imperial administration was supplanted by a migration of Massa rulers. Contrary to their reputation, these rulers conquered the Isles peacefully, and have merged with the locals. Folks of this mixed culture now call themselves Biscanjans, unifying their Calradoi legacy with the Massa language."/>
	
	<string id="str_culture_rich_name.kannic" text="{=str_culture_rich_name.kannic.text}Kannic"/>
	<string id="str_culture_description.kannic" text="{=str_culture_description.kannic.text}The Kannic are an ancient Calradian civilization based on the southern coasts of the Perass and Jade seas. They first built Razih, and later proceeded to colonize the entire southern coast. They were renowned for their masonry and shipbuilding: before the Calradoi or the Geroiako dominated the seas, it was the domain of the Kannic triremes, adorned with the vines of their goddess. The Vine Goddess, Ailatyn, guides the Kannic both in trade and war. To other cultures, they seem avaricious, but to the Kannic, making profit is a holy endeavour. The remainings of the Kannic now lie at Lys - their last large colony -, for much of their original lands have been taken by the Nahawasi, something for which the Kannic carry deep resentment. Their pristine stone cities, they say, shall one day be cleansed from the hut-dwelling nomads."/>
