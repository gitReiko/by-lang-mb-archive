  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.name.town_AV1" text="Averheim"/>
  <string id="town_AV1.text" text="Averheim, the capital of the Grand Province of Averland, is one of the oldest cities in the Empire. The site upon which the modern city now lies has been occupied since before the time of Sigmar when the Averlanders were still called Brigrundians. The dockyards here are particularly bustling due to the Aver serving as the primary trade route for the Halfling goods from the Moot into the wider empire. The bluff that the city sits upon protects the inhabitants from occasional flooding and has always served as an ideal crossing point across the Aver River; making the Griffin bridge one of the only places for many miles which provides access across the river for merchants and travellers heading north into Stirland or south into Averland. The skyline of the city is dominated by the Averburg Palace, a formidable fortress originally built around the founding of the Empire; views of the surrounding lands from the palace go for several miles all around the city. The city is famous for its cattle stockyards, the final destination of thousands of Averland cattle, the Plenzerplatz and of course its lord; Marious Lietdorf, the mad count of Averland."/>

The town hosts a small university and medical school, infamous for producing pupils who do not abide by the old ways. Streissen once held its own town charter, granting many tax exemptions and the ability to elect its own leaders, but this was revoked in a deal with the Countess Ludmilla Alptraum who saved the town from a student-led revolution. The university continues to operate with the memory of the purge following the Alptraum’s violent suppression still fresh in most residents’ minds. A ferry providing access across the Aver operates here."/>

  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.name.village_AV1_4" text="Heideck"/>
  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV1_4" text="Sat on the crossroads of the Old Dwarf Road, the town of Heideck was originally constructed by the Dwarfs during the height of their kingdoms several millennia ago.

  <string id="castle_AV2.text" text="Wuppertal is a picturesque Averlandish town, some might even say frozen in its cherished past. The city is known for carpentry, fine beer and ale (by human standards) and its tradition abiding Averlander inhabitants. The town also hosts many pilgrims and zealots, serving as one of the southern strongholds for the cult of Sigmar whose shrine here is dedicated to Joseph the Reverent. The town also hosts a large temple of Verena and a Garden of Morr.

  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_village_AV2_2" text="As a small town in southern Averland, Loningbruck serves as a crucial stop for merchants travelling along the Reik, either downriver towards Marienburg and the Great Ocean or upriver to the Dwarfen Kingdoms. One of the only roads leading to and from the Blackfire Pass also passes through Loningbruck. As a result of these mercantile interests, the town’s economy relies on the trade these routes bring, supplemented only by the sale of cattle. The town is dominated by The Crossed Keys, a large coaching inn, and the temple of Verena, the largest temple in town. Loningbruck unfortunatly also lends its name to Loningbruck Ruby, a infamously low-quality type of wine."/>

  <string id="town_AV3.text" text="The fortress town of Grenzstadt guards the approaches to and from the infamous Black Fire Pass. The Old Dwarf Road also passes through it on its northern route. As a result of its geography the town is in the perfect position to both facilitate trade with the Dwarfen Karaks and to guard against invasion by Greenskins and similar ilk coming through the Black Fire Pass. Tall and formidable walls and towers, and the size of its merchant quarter, enlarge the true size of the town. On any given day there are typically more visitors in the town than permanent inhabitants. Of these inhabitants, 1/10th of them are Dwarfs, here to serve as agents for their clans and to watch for human thieves seeking to sell stolen dwarf artefacts in the Empire. It is also known for Grenzstadter wine, high quality wine known for causing little to no hangover effects."/>

  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV3_1" text="The docks here at Hochsleben mark the end of the Upper Reik for boat traffic. While the river continues higher into the mountains for many miles, past this point the rapids, falls and ascent becomes far too dangerous for travel. As a result the town typically hosts a number of boats and ships, all plying their trade in goods going to or coming from the World’s edge mountains."/>

  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV3_2" text="Agbeiten is a large village that serves as both a mercantile and religious hub in Southern Averland.

On the northern end of the square are shrines to Sigmar, Ulric, and Verena. The round, timberbuilt Temple of Taal and Rhya is one of the largest in the Southern Empire and one of the few located within the stone walls of a town.

  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST1_1" text="Biberhof lies surrounded by thick forest just a few kilometers south of Wurtbad. Its inhabitants have become quite skilled in the use of the axe, both to harvest high quality wood from the old trees around it and defending their camps from vermin and the occasional highwayman.

  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_ST1_3" text="Oberwil is a small fishing village a few miles West of Wurtbad.

  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.castle_ST3" text="Halstedt Keep is on the South-East edge of the Stirhügel hills and is a staging point for the Roadwardens of the region. Originally it was a manor house belonging to some long forgotten lord, over time it has become more fortified as each subsequent owner has sought to protect its inhabitants against bandits and the greenskins from nearby Altern Forest.

Its ruler, Count Petr von Stolpe, has faced the Undead many times in his life and takes many measures to prepare for their return. Many witch hunters and vampire hunters have taken up residence here as a result. The town is notable for hosting a far larger temple and Garden of Morr than the number of inhabitants would otherwise require, for Count von Stolpe feels it is his obligation to ensure proper burials for all who die in his demesne."/>

Stewardship over Siegfriedhof was granted to the Morrian templars by the Elector Count of Stirland, in gratitude for the Order's contribution in the Battle of Hel Fenn, 400 years prior. The town is also the site of the Abbey of Blessed Aethelbert the Vigilant. Due to the significant cult presence of the Morrians, Siegfriedhof is often used as a staging area for agents to keep watch over Sylvania. The people of Siegfriedhof are quite suspicious of strangers, and preemptive lynchings of unknown travellers have been known to occur."/>

Emperor Magnus the Pious in the 24th century attempted to restore Solland, defining its borders with Averland and Wissenland and reconstituting it as the Grand Barony of Solland. However, Solland still remains heavily intertwined with Wissenland and despite several legal agreements is in reality a part of Wissenland.

The Guild does most of their business out of the dwarf constructed and fortified Guildhaus, which is said to be where the guild stores most of its silver ingots for later use by its members.

The city itself is built within a huge shallow crater called the Taalbaston, which is many miles across, whose outer edge formed a large rocky rim and a natural wall. This wall has been built up and fortified with many tall gun towers and effectively marks the boundary of the city itself. The land inside is extensive and includes fertile farmlands, a lake filled with fresh water as well as the grand city itself, ensuring that should a mighty enemy be able to breach through Talabecland's armies, so long as the enemy is held back by the great crater walls, the city and its proud people can withstand the onslaught of siege almost indefinitely. The River Talabec flows around the outside of the crater, and where it flows past the north-eastern edge of the wall, there is a fortified Imperial town known as Taalagrad and a deep harbour from which lies the river fleets. The largest of Talabheim’s temples is dedicated to Taal and to a lesser extent Rhya.

  <string id="town_WA1.text" text="Marienburg is one of the greatest human cities in the Old World, and possibly the wealthiest, rivalled only by Altdorf, Erengrad, Miragliano, and the richest cities of Araby. Situated at the point where the River Reik enters the Sea of Claws, Marienburg is the only route for maritime trade to efficiently leave or enter the Empire. The city itself sits on a series of islands connected together by bridges and boat travel. To the north and south, the Vloedmuur wall sits just off the coast to defend the city from flooding and attacks by land. The wall is an ancient one, originally built by elves. The modern wall has been built and rebuilt several times atop the old elven foundations and the Directorate - Marienburg’s executive council - has spent a great fortune modernising its gates and redoubts. The defence of the city from attacks along the Reik, or from the Manaanspoort Sea, falls on Marienburg’s substantial navy. Just a century ago, the Wasteland was one of the jewels of Sigmar's empire, but after generations of benign neglect by a series of successive emperors, the merchants and burghers of Marienburg declared their independence. Emperor Wilhelm III launched several unsuccessful expeditions against the separatist province, all of which failed, culminating in independence being granted by treaty in 2429. Today, Marienburg is ruled by its legislature, the Stadsraad, and its executive council, the Directorate. Under this ‘republican’ rule, trade has continued to flow through Marienburg and many consider the city to be in a golden age. It is protected by its reputation of being nearly ungovernable and its varied mercenary forces, as well as by the River Reik and the marshes and swamps around. Nevertheless, the new Emperor, Karl Franz, may want to accomplish what his great-great-grandfather was unable to do. At the same time, Bretonnian dukes have made attempts in the past to incorporate Marienburg into their domains; who knows if King Louen will make an attempt of his own to expand the Marches of Couronne?"/>

A mile long curtain wall encloses the castle, which consists of two large keeps and many other outbuildings. Duke Hagen is rarely seen in either the castle or the city at his feet as he is normally in Couronne or on campaign, and so his steward Lord Hincmar lives in one of the two keeps, while the other remains deserted. The city sprawls from the rivers’ shores to the castle’s ridge; It is a busy place, filled with more Imperial and Wastelander traders than any other city in Bretonnia, it may in fact be the only place in the world were the name of Marienburg does not conjure up images of sea vessels. Much of the city is dominated by streets of fine merchant houses pressed up against horrid tenements and decaying homes, many of which once belonged to fine merchant families. In Gisoreux, it is said that merchant families will only keep their wealth for one generation. As can be expected by its location, the city and castle has been besieged numerous times over its long history, but any knight of the dukedom will be quick to tell you that it has fallen not once due to her valiant knights."/>

There is no permanent residence here for its lord, Duke Hagen, and so any fortifications and buildings here have been wrought by the peasantry over many centuries of inhabitation. The town is the only stop on the trail to the Vale of Florida, and it is from here that many nobles have attempted to sponsor further settlement of the Pale sisters. All of these attempts have failed miserably, either due to the harsh winters or greenskin incursions; and so it has been some time since further settlement has been tried."/>

A stream flows off the mountains to the south of the village, irrigating the vale for farming, and dropping in a spectacular waterfall to join the headwaters of the River Sannez below. The soil of the vale in particular seems to nourish a certain flavour in grapes. The flavour is said to be an acquired taste, but many aficionados will travel from far and wide to acquire it."/>

Slightly higher up the ridge from the present Castle Oisillon is a large area of Ruins.

The beastmen can sense the aura of purity it radiates and frequently attack the village.

If not for the then Sir Chlodega the city would’ve been razed completely. Sir Chlodega led a charge deep into the ranks of the beastmen, so forceful was the charge that it toppled even the cygors. The sounds of carnage and death lured out the other beasts that roamed the city, and after an epic battle the knight slaughtered every single one of them. The city, what was left of it, was saved.
