  <string id="averland.text" text="The Grand County of Averland is a major and founding Imperial Province that lies directly to the south-east of the Empire. Averland has an economy based mostly on agriculture, and the raising of cattle and livestock. Unlike most states in the Empire, Averland contains large stretches of unbroken open plains and while this land is not as fertile as those in Ostermark, it proved valuable as grazing grounds for the infamous Averlander cattle herds. Averland also has the 'honour' of defending the site of Black Fire Pass, which leads across the Worlds Edge Mountains from the Dark Lands. This is the clearest pass for thousands of miles and as such, is a popular route for marauding Orcs and Goblins. As a result of years of defending it, the Averlanders are held in high esteem in the art of siege defences."/>

  <string id="stirland.text" text="The Grand County of Stirland is a major and founding Imperial Province that lies within the eastern territories of the Empire. Stirland is a rugged highland province famous for its rural backwater society and the province's close affiliation with death. Such attitude stems from the province close association with the province of Sylvania, a land perpetrated with misty forests and ancient castles resting on the craggy peaks like circling vultures. Ever since the end of the Vampire Wars, the province of Stirland has been given the rights to all the lands of eastern Sylvania. This essentially doubled the size of the province, but did little to improve the province's fortunes. Indeed, the province of Stirland is a relatively poor country in comparison to its surrounding southern neighbours such as Averland or Wissenland. The citizenry of Stirland are a conservative and superstitious lot, known for their backwards outlook and religious intolerance. The Banner of Stirland shows a skeleton sounding a hunting horn, signifying a call to battle. The skeleton itself is a common symbol of the lands, an expression of both the Stirlander battle cry -Victory or Death- and a grim reminder of the lands of Sylvania that they share borders with."/>
