  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Kingdom5" text="The Grand County of Averland is a major and founding Imperial Province that lies directly to the south-east of the Empire. Averland has an economy based mostly on agriculture, and the raising of cattle and livestock. Unlike most states in the Empire, Averland contains large stretches of unbroken open plains and while this land is not as fertile as those in Ostermark, it proved valuable as grazing grounds for the infamous Averlander cattle herds. Averland also has the honour of defending the site of Black Fire Pass, which leads across the Worlds Edge Mountains from the Dark Lands. This is the clearest pass for thousands of miles and as such, is a popular route for marauding Orcs and Goblins. As a result of years of defending it, the Averlanders are held in high esteem in the art of siege defences."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Kingdom10" text="The Grand County of Stirland is a major and founding Imperial Province that lies within the eastern territories of the Empire. Stirland is a rugged highland province famous for its rural backwater society and the provinces close affiliation with death. Such attitude stems from the province close association with the province of Sylvania, a land perpetrated with misty forests and ancient castles resting on the craggy peaks like circling vultures. Ever since the end of the Vampire Wars, the province of Stirland has been given the rights to all the lands of eastern Sylvania. This essentially doubled the size of the province, but did little to improve the provinces fortunes. Indeed, the province of Stirland is a relatively poor country in comparison to its surrounding southern neighbours such as Averland or Wissenland. The citizenry of Stirland are a conservative and superstitious lot, known for their backwards outlook and religious intolerance. The Banner of Stirland shows a skeleton sounding a hunting horn, signifying a call to battle. The skeleton itself is a common symbol of the lands, an expression of both the Stirlander battle cry -Victory or Death- and a grim reminder of the lands of Sylvania that they share borders with."/>

The province of Wissenland is considered the armory of the Empire, for it holds within its borders the city-state of Nuln, the largest industrial city within the Old World. From its workshops and factories, the city of Nuln churns out some of the most devastating black-powder weaponry known to Mankind. Wissenlands territories was originally confined between the Grey Mountains and the River Soll, but following the destruction of Solland in 1707 IC, the territories of Solland were given to Wissenland. Ever since then, the people of Wissenland have expressed a degree of sorrow and remembrance for their neighbors, going as far as to add the flag of Solland upon their own banners as a sign of respect for their fallen countrymen."/>

Indeed, just in the Forest of Chȃlons is said to be where Gilles and the Companions first met The Lady. Because Bastonne is the Heart of Bretonnia, the people of Bastonne are the most haughty and cocky of the Bretonnians. Bastonne holds in its service most of Bretonnias grail Knights, and rightly claims to be the most important of all Duchies."/>

Known for having some of the most serene lands in Bretonnia, Aquitaine is renowned for its cultivable farmlands and smooth sandy shores. Because of its isolation from many outside threats, much of the violence that occurs is in fact from petty squabbles between dukes, or peasant uprisings and revolts.Ruler Description: Inheriting the Duchy of Aquitaine after his elder brother had passed, Duke Armand d Aquitaine was the current standard bearer of Bretonnia, after his questing knight ventures led him to become a grail knight. After hearing the news of his brothers death, he was bidden by decree that he take the throne of Aquitaine. He now leads the duchy both as an administrator and as a Marshall."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Kingdom65" text="Brionne is often called the Jewel of Bretonnia… by Brionnians. It genuinely is a remarkably beautiful city, set on a peninsula linked to the mainland by a narrow neck. The peninsula forms a hill, and the city winds up the side, built with the local white stone or, for peasant buildings, white plaster. The sand of the bay is extremely good for making glass, so virtually every window inthe city is glazed, and they sparkle in the sunlight. Castle Brionne is at the centre of the city and the peak of the island. It is what other Brionnian castles want to be: the perfect merging of fanciful form and flawless functionality. The many small turrets might appear to be haphazard, but they provide excellent fields of fire. Similarly, the tall, slender towers hold watchposts that can be defended by one man against an army and command much of the area around. The many courtyard gardens can be sealed and turned into killing rooms to dispose of invaders. The Hall of Minstrels in Brionne is the most important centre for those entertainers in the world. It stands on a small prominence in the southern quarter of the city, and is surrounded by a garden. The building itself is circular, built of white stone, and home to an auditorium with flawless acoustics. Minstrels can be found performing there at any time of the day or night."/>

Under the shadow of the Vampires, its populace has become a terrified, superstitious people. Close to uninhabitable, Sylvanias forests are dingy copses of twisted, half-rotted trees that claw what nourishment they can from the bone-strewn soil. Desolate moorlands and sluggish rivers of clotted blood punctuate the yellow-leafed woods, wind-swept and storm­ shrouded by dark clouds that seep down from the Worlds Edge Mountains on an almost daily basis."/>

One fateful night, a Vampire known as Walach Harkon challenged every Knight to single combat, eventually turning all who he deemed worthy into Vampires. The death of the Ordo Draconis was followed by their rebirth in blood; ever since then these terrifying warriors have been known as the Blood Dragons. The Imperials suffered under their attacks and depravations for sixty years, before they amassed a force to raze the Keep. That was almost six centuries ago, for all that time the ruins of the keep lay undisturbed. Now, the keep rises again, built by the silent undead, and the men of the Empire will again know fear."/>
