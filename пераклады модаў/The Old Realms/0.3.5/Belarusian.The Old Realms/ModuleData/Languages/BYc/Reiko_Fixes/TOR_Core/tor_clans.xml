  <string id="sylvania_clan_1.text" text="They say history is made by great men and women. That is certainly true for the Vampires, but none have written that history so boldly or so thick with blood as the Von Carsteins. They are the aristocracy of the night, creatures of enormous passion and unbridled ambition, and their most trivial desires shape the destinies of entire nations. They are the greatest of all the accursed bloodlines, their vile breed spawned from the ancient terror, Count Vlad von Carstein. For centuries, they have waged their war on the living, Vlad’s seed forever tainting the land and soddening the earth with blood. Near four hundred years ago, the last great count of Sylvania, Mannfred von Carstein, was slain at the battle of Hel Fenn. Now, he has returned, to reclaim what was rightly once his."/>

  <string id="sylvania_clan_2.text" text="Even before the coming of Vlad von Carstein and his bloodthirsty children, Sylvania was a cursed land, loathed by the Empire as a haven for Necromancers and Sorcerers. Many of these dark practitioners were those who ruled the unquiet graves, lords and nobles that studied the forbidden arts for power and longevity. In the centuries since the von Carsteins came to power, the mortal nobility and the vampiric aristocracy have formed a symbiotic relationship, a mutual assurance that Sylvania will forever remain in the hands of those who wield the power of Nagash. Though Vampire Counts have risen and fallen, the nobility have remained, powerful Necromancers who forever seek the wisdom of Nagash."/>

  <string id="sylvania_clan_4.text" text="During the Third Vampire War, it is said that Mannfred von Carstein came upon a lonely tower in the mountains and  petitioned his distant blood-cousins, the Blood Dragons of Abhorash, for their aid in his bid to conquer the Empire of Sigmar. Whatever the price he promised, the Blood Dragons marched alongside the Prince of Sylvania, fell warriors of unmatched martial prowess and oathed by honour to the von Carstein cause. Though the war ended and Mannfred was slain, some of the Blood Dragons remained, taking their due right of Sylvanian soil for their service. As the only other Vampiric bloodline of note in Sylvania, the Blood Dragons have carved a dark reputation, as warriors without equal and sworn only to those they deem worthy. When Mannfred returned once more, he bound the Blood Dragons to their oaths once more, and again the Blood Dragons rode to war."/>

One fateful night, a Vampire known as Walach Harkon challenged every Knight to single combat, eventually turning all who he deemed worthy into Vampires. The death of the Ordo Draconis was followed by their rebirth in blood; ever since then these terrifying warriors have been known as the Blood Dragons. The Imperials suffered under their attacks and depravations for sixty years, before they amassed a force to raze the Keep. That was almost six centuries ago, for all that time the ruins of the keep lay undisturbed. Now, the keep rises again, built by the silent undead, and the men of the Empire will again know fear."/>

This alliance is difficult to maintain even at the best of times due to Alberich’s young age and the general insecurity of his house.

  <string id="stirland_clan_2.text" text="While the lords of western Stirland are content to bicker over trade with the Moot and Averland, the lords of the East are all too aware of the trouble brewing on their border. The dead are restless, crops are failing and more and more ill tidings come out of the county of Sylvania. Already it has been many months since they were last able to contact the lords of that land, and now the roads east are far too dangerous to try now. The omens do not lie however; the eastern lords have watched the once fertile land darken from the corruption  that their advising magisters say is coming from further east. As a result, they have abandoned any ideas of peace, and have prepared for war or worse to come. Travelling through this region of Stirland will render the same impression; these are the border folk of the empire: they are the first line of defence against evil and are willing to meet it head on."/>

  <string id="talabecland_clan_1.text" text="The Chosen of Taal is the ruling clan of Talabecland. This clan was formed through the union of two families; Countess Elise’s, the ruler of Talabheim, and Grand Duke Helmut Feuerbach, the ruler of the Grand Duchy of Talabecland. The families knew it would be foolish for Taal’s children to feud over control of his holy land and so the political alliance was cemented with marriage. The dynasty is now in its second generation of rulers; Gustav XI Krieglitz-Untern having established this alliance by the marriage of his daughter Elise to Helmut. As Elector Count, Helmut operates as the official ruler of both the clan and Talabecland, known for his iron fist and foul temper. Countess Elise is rumoured however to have far more to do with the true political decision making within the province and is known for her influence within both the Cults of Taal and Verena."/>

Nobles outside of von Schirach often complain about their aloofness and horrible manners; many times it can be difficult to get into contact with certain members due to the long pilgrimages through the holy places of Taal that they often embark on."/>
