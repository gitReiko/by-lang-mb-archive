That's when the Averland Treatise is born, while the other lords get swayed to and fro between the Alptraums and Leitdorfs, the lords in the treatise all band together and keep eachother secure in their own way."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan15" text="They say history is made by great men and women. That is certainly true for the Vampires, but none have written that history so boldly or so thick with blood as the Von Carsteins. They are the aristocracy of the night, creatures of enormous passion and unbridled ambition, and their most trivial desires shape the destinies of entire nations. They are the greatest of all the accursed bloodlines, their vile breed spawned from the ancient terror, Count Vlad von Carstein. For centuries, they have waged their war on the living, Vlad’s seed forever tainting the land and soddening the earth with blood. Near four hundred years ago, the last great count of Sylvania, Mannfred von Carstein, was slain at the battle of Hel Fenn. Now, he has returned, to reclaim what was rightly once his."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan16" text="Кашмарны Радавод"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan17" text="Even before the coming of Vlad von Carstein and his bloodthirsty children, Sylvania was a cursed land, loathed by the Empire as a haven for Necromancers and Sorcerers. Many of these dark practitioners were those who ruled the unquiet graves, lords and nobles that studied the forbidden arts for power and longevity. In the centuries since the von Carsteins came to power, the mortal nobility and the vampiric aristocracy have formed a symbiotic relationship, a mutual assurance that Sylvania will forever remain in the hands of those who wield the power of Nagash. Though Vampire Counts have risen and fallen, the nobility have remained, powerful Necromancers who forever seek the wisdom of Nagash."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan18" text="Пунсавы Ордэн"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan19" text="During the Third Vampire War, it is said that Mannfred von Carstein came upon a lonely tower in the mountains and  petitioned his distant blood-cousins, the Blood Dragons of Abhorash, for their aid in his bid to conquer the Empire of Sigmar. Whatever the price he promised, the Blood Dragons marched alongside the Prince of Sylvania, fell warriors of unmatched martial prowess and oathed by honour to the von Carstein cause. Though the war ended and Mannfred was slain, some of the Blood Dragons remained, taking their due right of Sylvanian soil for their service. As the only other Vampiric bloodline of note in Sylvania, the Blood Dragons have carved a dark reputation, as warriors without equal and sworn only to those they deem worthy. When Mannfred returned once more, he bound the Blood Dragons to their oaths once more, and again the Blood Dragons rode to war."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan20" text="Крывя Здрадніка"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan21" text="At the end of the third Vampire Wars and the cleansing of Gottlieb the Stern, the land of Sylvania was legally subsumed into the Grand County of Stirland. Even so, the land was forever a cursed and unloved place, rarely ventured into by the nobility that knew better. Instead, it became a place of exile, inheritance for prodigal sons and washed up nobility that had no place in the courts of Stirland. While many of these outcasts took to their new responsibilities with stoic determination, others sought greater opportunity. These are such traitors, kinslayers and deceivers who betrayed their homeland and family for damnation. They are the youngest of the vampires, newborn babes with the strength and appetite of daemons. Their only desire is to revel in their new unlife, to exult in their dark nature and live as gods among cowering men."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan23" text="Blood Keep was once the home of a valiant order of Knights known as the Order of the Blood Dragon, or the Ordo Draconis. One fateful night, a Vampire known as Walach Harkon challenged every Knight to single combat, eventually turning all who he deemed worthy into Vampires. The death of the Ordo Draconis was followed by their rebirth in blood; ever since then these terrifying warriors have been known as the Blood Dragons. The Imperials suffered under their attacks and depravations for sixty years, before they amassed a force to raze the Keep. That was almost six centuries ago, for all that time the ruins of the keep lay undisturbed. Now, the keep rises again, built by the silent undead, and the men of the Empire will again know fear."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan25" text="When first assuming power, Alberich Haupt-Anderssen focused all of his efforts in having a tight knit alliance between all of the other lords to ensure economic stability and the safety around Wurtzbach and in the west of Stirland.. This alliance is difficult to maintain even at the best of times due to Alberich’s young age and the general insecurity of his house. With an increasingly fraught eastern border with Sylvania, this alliance is growing more and more unsteady."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan26" text="Людзі Морру"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan27" text="While the lords of western Stirland are content to bicker over trade with the Moot and Averland, the lords of the East are all too aware of the trouble brewing on their border. The dead are restless, crops are failing and more and more ill tidings come out of the county of Sylvania. Already it has been many months since they were last able to contact the lords of that land, and now the roads east are far too dangerous to try now. The omens do not lie however; the eastern lords have watched the once fertile land darken from the corruption  that their advising magisters say is coming from further east. As a result, they have abandoned any ideas of peace, and have prepared for war or worse to come. Travelling through this region of Stirland will render the same impression; these are the border folk of the empire: they are the first line of defence against evil and are willing to meet it head on."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan29" text="Southern Stirland is home to the Skaranorak pilgrimage which spans from Schrambleben to the southern mountains. While this brings much popularity and allows for the church of sigmar to help with the effort to stave off the corruption of the undead, Southern Stirland does come with its problems, such as issues regarding outsiders and pilgrims stealing from reputable stores, halfling border disputes, and attempts to ambush pilgrims in the Zhufbar road which is used for the Skaranorak Pilgrimage."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan34" text="The Toppenheimers are a revered family that have dominated southern Wissenland and northern Solland for at least five centuries. The relationship with their vessels and subjects is an interesting one; for the Toppenheimers are often viewed as being neither fully Wissenlander or Sollander. This relationship has enabled them to act as kingmaker in Wissenland, giving whoever has their favour a great advantage over their rivals within and without the province."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan36" text="Solland was once full of hope and light. Now the people carry a great shame upon their soul, a weariness that seems to burden them with the pain of their ancestors. Solland has never recovered since its destruction by Greenskins many centuries ago, accordingly the once sanguine spirit of the people here has turned melancholic. The lords in this region are no different. They do what they can to ease the burden of their people, while always preparing for whatever may be coming with the next dawn."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan38" text="The Chosen of Taal is the ruling clan of Talabecland. This clan was formed through the union of two families; Countess Elise’s, the ruler of Talabheim, and Grand Duke Helmut Feuerbach, the ruler of the Grand Duchy of Talabecland. The families knew it would be foolish for Taal’s children to feud over control of his holy land and so the political alliance was cemented with marriage. The dynasty is now in its second generation of rulers; Gustav XI Krieglitz-Untern having established this alliance by the marriage of his daughter Elise to Helmut. As Elector Count, Helmut operates as the official ruler of both the clan and Talabecland, known for his iron fist and foul temper. Countess Elise is rumoured however to have far more to do with the true political decision making within the province and is known for her influence within both the Cults of Taal and Verena."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_Clan42" text="The Rindenhaut (Barkskin) Clan centres its power along the River Stir and in the wild places of Southern Talabecland. They are devout worshippers of Taal and many clan members will often seek to keep the Great Forest clear of befoulment alongside the wardens of the Cult of Taal such as the Longshanks and Druids. Nobles outside of von Schirach often complain about their aloofness and horrible manners; many times it can be difficult to get into contact with certain members due to the long pilgrimages through the holy places of Taal that they often embark on."/>

Parravon controls one of the 3 routes leading directly into the Empire from the Grey Mountains, that being Grey Lady Pass. Due to the duchy being situated both at the base and in the Grey Mountains, the Parravoners have an affinity with the resident Pegasi that reside within the mountain tops.

Being situated into the Mountainous regions, the Montfort peoples are hardy mountaineers themselves and due to constant raids, the Montfortians have developed a prejudice to any outsiders that are not Human, such as dwarfs, halflings, or elves."/>

Founded by Gilles le Breton, the Cathedral for the Cult of the Lady is housed within Castle Bastonne’s walls. Indeed, just in the Forest of Chȃlons is said to be where Gilles and the Companions first met The Lady. Because Bastonne is the Heart of Bretonnia, the people of Bastonne are the most haughty and cocky of the Bretonnians. Bastonne holds in its service most of Bretonnia’s grail Knights, and rightly claims to be the most important of all Duchies."/>

Their questing knights are particularly renowned amongst the dwarfs, as many of them use their grail quest to venture into the mountains and badlands of the Old World. Despite this, the greenskins remain an ever present threat to the Dukedom, despite centuries of attempted extermination and colonisation of Massif Orcal. It remains a mystery as to why Quenelles suffers so much from the greenskins compared to their neighbours; some suspect that the descendents of Cuileux may have been cursed."/>

To face either of these in battle is to feel the divine wrath of the Lady of the Lake herself. It is so much more terrifying than to face a pair of them on the same battlefield. For reasons unarticulated, Ser Leon and Lady Mathilde are rarely if ever parted from each other.
