  <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_AV1_1" text="Located just down river from the confluence of the rivers Aver and Lammer, the town of Streissen is known for its revolutionary spirit and volatile past. The town hosts a small university and medical school, infamous for producing pupils who do not abide by the old ways. Streissen once held its own town charter, granting many tax exemptions and the ability to elect its own leaders, but this was revoked in a deal with the Countess Ludmilla Alptraum who saved the town from a student-led revolution. The university continues to operate with the memory of the purge following the Alptraum’s violent suppression still fresh in most residents’ minds. A ferry providing access across the Aver operates here."/>

One of the only roads leading to and from the Blackfire Pass also passes through Loningbruck. As a result of these mercantile interests, the town’s economy relies on the trade these routes bring, supplemented only by the sale of cattle. The town is dominated by The Crossed Keys, a large coaching inn, and the temple of Verena, the largest temple in town. Loningbruck unfortunatly also lends its name to Loningbruck Ruby, a infamously low-quality type of wine."/>

Its inhabitants have become quite skilled in the use of the axe, both to harvest high quality wood from the old trees around it and defending their camps from vermin and the occasional highwayman.
