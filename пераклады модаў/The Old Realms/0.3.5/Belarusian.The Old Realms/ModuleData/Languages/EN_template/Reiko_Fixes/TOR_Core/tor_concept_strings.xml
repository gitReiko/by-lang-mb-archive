It will allow to choose your blood line. You either become a Vampire Count or start your adventure as a Blood Knight. {newline}   {newline} Being a Vampire  provides a unique set of bonuses and abilities, from the very start of your playthrough: You will start with the ability to raise the dead, you can move faster at night. You are more agile than humans{newline} Note that you also will be facing some disadvantages, for example you travel at day times slower. As a Vampire you will start your playthrough hated by the Empire and most other living factions.{newline} {newline} Necromancer:{newline} If you wish to start the game as a Necromancer, you must choose the Novice Necromancer option during character creation, this should be one of the final options given to you. Once selected you will load into the map with access to Necromancy magic and the ability to raise the dead after battles to supplement your army.{newline} {newline} Wizard/Magic Caster:{newline} To start the game as a magic caster, and this is applicable across most factions, you must select the correct final option during character creation, which will contain ‘+allows for the use of magic’ in the description.{newline} {newline} For example within the Empire, choosing to be a college acolyte upon game start, you will load into the game with access to magic. Once loaded into the campaign map a window will open to choose the lore of magic you want to specialise in, from this point onward you are free to play the campaign as normal with access to a number of starting spells. Note: You CANNOT learn more than one lore of magic as a human (unless you are Damsel, see {TOR_CAREERS}) .{newline} {newline} Priest and Damsel of the Lady:{newline} Priest careers can be selected upon starting the game. They provide strong battle prayers(see {TOR_PRAYERS}).  {newline} {newline} {newline} Knight Errants:{newline} The Knight of Bretonnia is one of the  unique {TOR_CAREERS} you can start with when playing as Bretonnia.{newline} {newline} {newline} Standard options: {newline} Choosing any other career start for your campaign will result in a similar experience as Vanilla Bannerlord, you will load into the game with gear based on your choice and the freedom to make your own story from scratch.

  <string id="str_tor_careers.text" text="Careers are a system you can engage with for both roleplaying and character development, providing unique skills and bonuses depending on what you choose to specialise in.

For every level your character gains one Career point.{newline}   {newline}   Within a playthrough you are supposed to specialise in a single career choice however there will be an option to change between careers but with penalties, such as losing all your progress and abilities earned. You will have your skill points returned to you so that you can advance in your new career choice.{newline}   {newline}   Note: Switching careers may of course result in the loss of magic, prayers or abilities that can reduce your overall battle strength.

Over time these negative effects will grow stronger.{newline}  {newline}  As a non-vampire or necromancer character, you can interact with these locations in a different way by conducting a warding ritual. This ritual will, temporarily, stop the recruitment of undead units by undead factions and will remove the negative penalties to the player, and any ‘good’ factions, related to the cursed location. To perform this ritual your party must have 9 people and some will take damage during the process.{newline}  {newline}"/>
  <string id="str_tor_damagesystem.title" text="Damage System"/>
  <string id="str_tor_damagesystem.text" text="We have implemented our own damage system which takes into account a variety of factors during battles, such as unit types and the damage or resistance modifiers being used by individual characters.

On the other side, magical resistances, like ethereal units take less damage from non-magic weapons.{newline}  {newline}  Damage types{newline}  - Physical - regular damage dealt from any weapon and sometimes spells. {newline}     - Magical - most spells deal magical damage. {newline}     - Fire - dealt by special guns and most bright wizard spells. {newline}     - Holy damage applies for most prayer abilities, or even certain holy warriors.{newline}     - Lighting - Heaven wizards and higher damsels make use of this damage type.{newline}  {newline}  Damage proportions{newline}  If a certain weapon or unit type is in possession of non-physical damage effects, their damage can be split into categories, for example spells deal full damage, aligned to the element of the magic in use.{newline}  {newline}  Buffs, Debuffs and resistances{newline}  Certain magical gear or abilities can enhance damage dealt, reduce damage taken or enhance a particular damage type. In a playthrough you may be able to both enhance the use of fire magic while also reducing damage taken from dark magic. It is important to note that resistances and damage buffs must match the damage type they are blocking or enhancing.{newline}  {newline}  Attack types{newline}  Certain buffs and spells  are only beneficial for certain attack types, which can be Spell damage, melee damage, or ranged damage. Only benefits that match the attack type, will be considered for the hit. {newline}     {newline}  Wardsave{newline}  A special form of resistance is the Wardsave.
