  <string id="Selonians_description" text="The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia mentions the Selonians at the beginning of the 13th century, when they were conquered and christened. The author of the chronicle describes the Selonians as Lithuanian allies. Their lands were subjects of the principalities of Jersika and Koknese, which were vassals of the principality of Polotsk. The Southern lands however were ruled by Lithuanian lords."/>
  <string id="Latgalians" text="Latgalians"/>
  <string id="Latgalians_description" text="The Latgalians are an Eastern Baltic tribe whose origin is little known. In the 5th and 6th centuries, they lived in the west of the Aiviekste River, and later on in nearly all the territory of that region. In the first two decades of the 13th century, the Western Latgalians allied with German (mainly Saxon) crusaders. Their lands (the Eldership of Tālava, the Principality of Jersika and the Principality of Koknese) were incorporated into Livonia as vassal states. In the 11th century, Eastern Orthodoxy started to spread in Latgalian lands from Polotsk and Pskov. In the 12th century, Latgalian lands and their rulers paid tribute to the dukes of Polotsk. During the Livonian crusade in the 13th century, Latgalian elders switched from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and became vassals of the Livonian Order."/>
  <string id="Livonians" text="Livonians"/>
  <string id="Livonians_description" text="The Livonians referred to themselves as rāndalist - 'coast dwellers' and supported themselves mainly by fishing, but also by agriculture and animal husbandry. Since they controlled an important trade route, the Daugava River, their culture was highly developed through trade with the Gotlanders, Rus and Finns, and, from the end of the first millennium AD onwards, with the Germans, Swedes and Danes. During the Livonian Crusade, once prosperous Livonia was devastated, and whole regions were almost completely depopulated. This vacuum was filled by Curonians, Semigallians, Latgallians and Selonians – who started to move into the area around 1220, and continued to do so for at least thirty years."/>
  <string id="Oeselians" text="Oeselians"/>
  <string id="Oeselians_description" text="On the eve of Northern Crusades, the people then residing in Saaremaa(Ösel) were described in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle: The Oeselians, neighbors to the Kurs (Curonians), are surrounded by the sea and never fear strong armies as their strength is in their ships. In summers when they can travel across the sea they oppress the surrounding lands by raiding both Christians and pagans"/>
