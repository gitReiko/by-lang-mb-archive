Prussian tribes are organized in a loose confederation led by local chieftains. Their society is largely tribal and clan-based, with leaders known as 'kriwe' or 'kriwes' who hold both religious and political authority. These leaders are supported by a council of nobles or elders. The Prussian tribes do not have a centralized state structure, and their political organization are more focused on local governance and tribal coalitions, which often shifted alliances and rivalries."/>

  <string id="Duchy_of_Estonia_desc" text="The conquest of Northern Estonia, culminating in the establishment of Danish rule in 1219, was achieved under King Valdemar II of Denmark, known as Valdemar the Victorious. This significant event took place during the Northern Crusades, a period characterized by the Christian states of Northern Europe launching military campaigns against the pagan tribes of the Baltic region. The pivotal moment occurred at the Battle of Lindanise, on June 15, 1219, where Danish forces decisively defeated the Estonian tribes.{newline}{newline}The battle is famously noted for the legendary appearance of the Dannebrog, the flag of Denmark, which is said to have fallen from the skies during a critical point in the battle, boosting the morale of the Danish troops and leading to their victory. {newline}{newline}This victory not only solidified Danish influence in Estonia but also marked the beginning of significant Christianization and the establishment of feudal structures throughout the region. Under Danish rule, Reval was fortified and developed into a major center of commerce and governance, integrating Northern Estonia more closely into the broader European economic and cultural sphere."/>

  <string id="kingdom.polack.text" text="From the second half of the 11th century vasal-union relations began to form between Połack and Lithuania. The reason for consolidation was a common enemy – Kievan Rus. Initially Połack played a leading role. But as time went on, Lithuania took that place. In 1259, thanks to a dynastic marriage, the Lithuanian prince Tautvilas ruled in Połack. The Połack principalities became vassal princedoms, fought with Lithuania against common enemies: Golden Horde and Teutonic Order, but were not yet part of Lithuania. They had high autonomy, and many Połack princes fought for the main throne, Połack, among themselves and external enemies, including Lithuania."/>
