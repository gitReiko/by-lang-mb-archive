  <string id="wand_balt_10_1" text="My story? It’s one of hunger, cold nights, and the greed of men that left me with nothing."/>
  <string id="wand_balt_10_2" text="I grew up in a small hut near the forest. My father hunted for what he could, but the seasons were cruel, and we were always hungry. The chieftain of our tribe demanded more tribute each year, and when we had no more grain to give, he took our only goat."/>
  <string id="wand_balt_10_3" text="My mother tried to reason with him, but they laughed at us. That night, a sickness took her, and I buried her with my bare hands. My father followed soon after, leaving me alone. The forest became my home, and the shadows my only friends."/>
  <string id="wand_balt_10_4" text="I learned to steal from the traders who passed through. A bit of bread here, a strip of dried meat there. I was quick and quiet, and for a while, I survived. But life in the woods is harsh, and I learned that even the smallest mistake could be deadly."/>
  <string id="wand_balt_10_5" text="Survival demands a certain cruelty. Who could blame you?"/>
  <string id="wand_balt_10_6" text="Living as a thief will catch up with you eventually."/>
  <string id="wand_balt_10_7" text="I’ve had enough of living in the shadows. There’s no future for a girl like me out there. So now, I wander, hoping to find something better, something that doesn’t end in a shallow grave beneath the trees."/>
  <string id="wand_balt_10_8" text="I’ve lived in the woods for as long as I can remember, surviving by stealing what I could. But that life wears you down, and I’m looking for a way out. Perhaps I’ll find it in the towns or on the roads."/>
  <string id="wand_balt_11_1" text="My story? You could say bad luck followed me like a hungry wolf."/>
  <!--input/wanderer_strings/wanderer_strings_crusader.xml-->
  <string id="wand_crus_12_1" text="My story? It’s the tale of a young girl trying to survive in a world that cares little for the weak."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_12_2" text="My family was poor, and the winters were long. We barely scraped by, tending to our sheep, hoping the wool they provided would be enough to feed us. My father died when I was young, and my mother was too ill to work, so the burden fell on me."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_12_3" text="I walked to the market every week, a basket full of wool on my back. The merchants were cruel, always driving the price down, knowing I had no choice but to accept. Still, it was all we had. Every coin I earned went to keep us alive, but it was never enough."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_12_4" text="One day, my mother passed away, and with her, the last bit of hope I had. I was alone, with nothing but a few ragged clothes and the knowledge that I had to fend for myself. So I kept going, selling what little I could, but it became harder and harder to make ends meet."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_12_5" text="It’s a harsh world for those without means. You did what you had to do."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_12_6" text="Selling wool might have kept you alive, but it won’t get you far."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_12_7" text="I couldn’t live like that forever. The market life, the constant hunger, the endless struggle... it broke me. So I left. Now I wander, searching for something better, something that doesn’t involve counting every last coin to survive."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_12_8" text="I used to sell wool at the market, trying to keep my family fed. But that life is behind me now. I’m searching for a new path, one that doesn’t involve begging for scraps from greedy merchants."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_1" text="My story? It’s not one of noble birth or riches. I never knew my parents, only the cold of the sewers."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_2" text="I was born in the filth of the city streets, or so I’m told. I never knew my mother or father. I grew up with the rats, scavenging what I could from the trash and muck. When the hunger became too much, I learned to trap the very creatures I shared my home with."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_3" text="Life in the sewers isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s dark, cold, and filled with things that would rather see you dead. But I learned to survive. I hunted rats for food, stole scraps from the market stalls above, and kept to the shadows, always one step ahead of the guards."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_4" text="I’ve never known kindness, only the fight to stay alive. The sewers were my home, but they were also my prison. I knew I couldn’t live like that forever. So I made my way out, desperate for something better, though I have no idea where to start."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_5" text="Surviving in the sewers takes more strength than many would realize."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_6" text="Living like that, it’s a wonder you made it this far."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_7" text="I’m done with the sewers. The filth, the hunger, the endless struggle... it’s no life for anyone. Now I wander, hoping to find a better path, one that doesn’t lead back to the gutter."/>
  <string id="wand_crus_13_8" text="I grew up in the sewers, surviving on whatever I could find. It wasn’t much of a life, so I left, hoping to find something better above the streets."/>
  <!--input/wanderer_strings/wanderer_strings_danish.xml-->
  <string id="wand_danish_12_1" text="My story? It’s one of poverty, desperation, and tears over lost locks of hair."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_12_2" text="We were always poor. My mother did what she could to keep us fed, but there was never enough. One day, she told me we had no choice. She took her knife and cut my hair, saying it could be sold to buy food. I cried until my eyes were sore, but that didn’t bring my hair back."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_12_3" text="The town’s merchant paid a few coins for my hair, and we ate that night, but I felt like a piece of me was taken with those locks. My mother said I should be proud that I helped keep us alive, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of loss. Every time I touched my head, I was reminded of how little we had."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_12_4" text="I never let my hair grow long again. The pain of losing it once was enough, and I couldn’t bear to have it happen again. So I kept it short, and we struggled on, always one step away from starvation. Life wasn’t kind to us, and in the end, I had to leave, hoping to find a better life somewhere else."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_12_5" text="You did what you had to do. Survival demands sacrifices."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_12_6" text="Losing your hair for a few coins... that must have been hard to bear."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_12_7" text="I couldn’t stay. The pain of that life weighed on me every day. So I left. Now I wander, searching for something more, something that doesn’t involve selling parts of myself just to survive."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_12_8" text="I grew up poor, so poor that my mother cut my hair and sold it to buy food. We struggled, and I couldn’t stay in that life. Now I’m looking for a way out, a chance at something better."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_1" text="My story? It’s the smell of saltwater and fish guts, following me wherever I go."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_2" text="I grew up on the sea, helping my father on his fishing boat. We lived for the catch, and every day I was surrounded by fish—alive, dead, or rotting in the sun. The sea fed us, but it also left its mark. No matter how much I scrubbed, the smell never went away."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_3" text="The other villagers kept their distance. They called me ‘Fish-boy’ and wrinkled their noses whenever I walked by. I didn’t mind at first—after all, fishing was all I knew. But as I grew older, the isolation started to wear on me. I was tired of being the one who always smelled like the sea."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_4" text="Even when I left the boat behind, the smell stayed with me. It clung to my skin, my clothes... people could sense it from across the room. No one wanted to be near me. So I left the village, hoping to find a place where I could start fresh, away from the stench of fish and salt."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_5" text="A life on the sea might toughen you up, but I suppose the smell is a part of that."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_6" text="Carrying the scent of the sea everywhere... I can see why that would be hard."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_7" text="I couldn’t stay there any longer. I’ve had enough of the fish, the sea, and the loneliness. Now I wander, looking for a place where people don’t wrinkle their noses at me before I even speak."/>
  <string id="wand_danish_13_8" text="I spent my life on a fishing boat, surrounded by the smell of fish and saltwater. It never left me, and neither did the stares from others. Now I’m searching for a place where I can be free of that past."/>
  <!--input/wanderer_strings/wanderer_strings_latvian.xml-->
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_1" text="My story? I’m the daughter of nobility—or at least, I believe I am. That life was taken from me."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_2" text="I grew up in a grand castle, or so my parents said. They told me we were of noble blood, that our line was ancient and respected. I believed them. I spent my days in the hallways of that castle, dreaming of the life that noble birthright promised me."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_3" text="But those dreams turned to ash. One night, men in iron armor came—they set our castle ablaze. I remember the flames climbing higher, consuming everything. My parents told me to run, and so I did. I escaped into the forest, the last thing I saw was the man standing in the doorway as the castle crumbled behind him."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_4" text="In the forest, I was alone. I had no one, nothing. I survived by eating mushrooms and berries, drinking from streams, and hiding from the beasts of the woods. Somehow, I lived, though I’m not sure how. But I could never shake the feeling that my noble blood would protect me, even when there was nothing left of that life."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_5" text="To survive the loss of everything... it takes strength, noble or not."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_6" text="A noble birth means little when you’re alone in the woods."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_7" text="I’ve wandered for so long now, leaving the forest behind, but the memories still follow me. I’m searching for a way to reclaim what I lost—or maybe to find out if it was ever real to begin with."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_10_8" text="I grew up believing I was a noble, living in a grand castle. But that life was burned away by enemies. I survived in the forest, but now I wander, searching for a way back to the life I lost."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_1" text="My story? It’s one of fire, sweat, and chains. I spent my youth as a slave, chained to the blacksmith's forge."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_2" text="I was born into servitude, or so it feels. From a young age, I was forced to work the bellows and carry heavy iron bars for the blacksmith in the castle. The heat from the furnace was unbearable, and the smell of burning metal and sweat never left me. My back is still sore from all the beatings I took when I wasn’t fast enough."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_3" text="Every day was the same—slaving away in the forge, knowing that I’d never be free. My hands became calloused, and my lungs burned from the constant smoke. The blacksmith was a cruel master, quick with his fists and slow with mercy. I knew I couldn’t live that life forever."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_4" text="One night, after another beating left me too weak to stand, I decided I’d had enough. I waited until the castle was quiet, and then I ran. I ran until my legs couldn’t carry me anymore, and then I hid. I knew that if they found me, they’d drag me back to the forge, but anything was better than that furnace."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_5" text="To escape a life of servitude takes courage. You must have been desperate."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_6" text="Running from the forge was dangerous, but I can see why you did it."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_7" text="I don’t know where I’m going, but I know I can’t go back to that life. The fire, the chains, the constant pain... I need to find something better, or at least something that isn’t another prison."/>
  <string id="wand_latvian_11_8" text="I spent my youth as a slave, working in a blacksmith’s forge. The heat and the pain were unbearable, so I ran, hoping to find freedom somewhere beyond the castle walls."/>
  <!--input/wanderer_strings/wanderer_strings_rus.xml-->
  <string id="wand_rus_10_1" text="My story? It’s one of anger, rebellion, and the price of defying my family."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_10_2" text="I was born into a boyar family, where I was expected to be the perfect, obedient daughter. But I didn’t want that life. I was angry—angry at my parents for trying to control me, for treating me like a puppet. So I did what I could to defy them: I gave my body to every slave, every guard and every boyar!"/>
  <string id="wand_rus_10_3" text="When they found out, they were furious. They locked me in my room, screamed at me until their voices were hoarse. My mother wept, my father raged. They even called in the priest, thinking I was possessed or cursed. He tried to cleanse me with prayers and rituals, but it did nothing. The anger was still there, burning inside me."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_10_4" text="After days of being locked away, I knew I couldn’t stay any longer. I refused to be their prisoner. So one night, I slipped out of the window and ran. I didn’t know where I was going, but anywhere was better than being under their control. I wanted to live my own life, without them dictating my every move."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_10_5" text="Defying your parents like that must have taken a lot of courage, even if it meant leaving everything behind."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_10_6" text="Running away from your family may have freed you, but it also left you alone in the world."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_10_7" text="I don’t know what I’ll do now, but I know I can’t go back. I won’t let them control me, and I won’t live a life they’ve chosen for me. I’ll find my own path, even if it means walking it alone."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_10_8" text="I was the daughter of a boyar, but I rebelled against my parents. I gave myself out of anger, and when they tried to control me, I ran away. Now, I’m searching for a life that’s truly mine, far from their influence."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_1" text="My story? It’s one of laziness, warmth, and a harsh wake-up call after my parents passed away."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_2" text="I was born to a pair of hard-drinking parents. They didn’t ask much of me, and I didn’t offer much in return. All my life, I spent my days lying on the warm stove, pretending to be ill or sleeping whenever there was work to be done. Why bother when the stove was so comfortable, and there was nothing worth getting up for?"/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_3" text="While my parents drank away their days, I lay there, doing nothing, thinking I could live like that forever. But nothing lasts forever. One day, the drink finally took them both, and I was left alone. For the first time in my life, I had to climb down from that stove. I didn’t have a clue what to do."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_4" text="I tried to survive, but I was hopeless. I had never done anything for myself before. I didn’t know how to work, how to gather food, how to live. So, with no other choice, I left the house and wandered into town, hoping to find someone who could teach me how to survive."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_5" text="Sounds like you had an easy life—until reality caught up with you."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_6" text="Learning to survive after doing nothing for so long must have been tough."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_7" text="I don’t know what I’ll do next, but I know I can’t go back to that old life. The stove is gone, and now I have to figure out how to survive on my own, one day at a time."/>
  <string id="wand_rus_11_8" text="I spent my life lying on the warm stove, doing nothing, while my parents drank themselves to death. When they were gone, I had no choice but to leave and try to survive. Now, I’m looking for a way to make it on my own."/>
