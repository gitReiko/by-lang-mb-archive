  <string id="Ruin_01.name" text="Hullizwiek"/>
  <string id="Ruin_01.text" text="An old border castle that burnt to the ground during the same blaze in which its lord and both his heirs died. Dark tales persist of how both heirs died while arguing over the smouldering body of their lord and leige."/>
  <string id="Ruin_02.name" text="Haelinsten"/>
  <string id="Ruin_02.text" text="A town whose main export was fine quality cut stone. The stone was quarried from granite slopes above the town until a landslide, believed triggered by torrential rains, engulfed the buildings and buried most of the townsfolk. With the town and population all but destroyed, petty fires and vandals gutted the remains."/>
  <string id="Ruin_03.name" text="Versbrock"/>
  <string id="Ruin_03.text" text="This castle was overrun by bandits in the dead of night. The owner was widely renowned for lavish banquets and generosity to his guards. Perhaps he was too kind, as survivors of the attack spread bitter talk of guards too drunk to stand, let alone fight."/>
  <string id="Ruin_04.name" text="Oristocorys Castle"/>
  <string id="Ruin_04.text" text="Old Oristocorys Castle, being so removed from the world at large, was simply abandoned after the owner's work within the empire led locals to view him as an absentee landlord and disregard his right to rule.  Walls were torn down and robbed for houses, goods were pilfered, but soon after the half-pillaged remains were reduced to a burnt out wreck when squatting locals set fire to the remaining structures."/>
  <string id="Ruin_05.name" text="Arlumeque"/>
  <string id="Ruin_05.text" text="The local Battanian peasantry complained often and loudly of this Empire-governed castle imposing draconian taxes upon them, so when a bandit raid burned the stronghold to ruins it was these same complaints that led to a swift and brutal rounding up of great many 'bandits', their bodies hung from the ruins of the once-proud castle."/>
  <string id="Ruin_06.name" text="Harvatbo"/>
  <string id="Ruin_06.text" text="This stronghold once belonged to a Strugian Boyar that refused to join the rest of Strugia in their union. The Boyar was declared a rebel, and most of their lands were taken by force. The castle was considered ill-omened, and left to fall into ruins. Nothing stands in the way of progress."/>
  <string id="Ruin_07.name" text="Tumkbuss"/>
  <string id="Ruin_07.text" text="The woods were haunted, everyone knew that. Don't be so foolish as to site a village there, you'll regret it!  But despite the warnings, full of hope and ambition and expectation their village was founded in the shadows of those cursed trees. Six months later nothing remained but overgrown, decaying timbers and ragged corpses bloated by the rain."/>
  <string id="Ruin_08.name" text="Tevinjati"/>
  <string id="Ruin_08.text" text="The murmurings of dark and evil forces at work in the mountains were as old as the peaks themselves; don't venture there on a full moon, never go without your spear and another brave soul to watch your back. But the ritual stones in the woods have stood since the time before men, so what foul acts have they seen and what dark secrets do they hide?"/>
  <string id="Ruin_09.name" text="Virvallis"/>
  <string id="Ruin_09.text" text="There was once a great road that passed near here but the petty and greedy local lord refused to pay the cost of its maintenance and instead imposed cruel, punitive taxes on the peasants for the temerity of even suggesting how he might rule his lands.  In the end the villagers simply moved on. The village quietly became a shelter for bandits and other criminals, and none now speak of that petty lord's folly."/>
  <string id="Ruin_10.name" text="Turrimmons"/>
  <string id="Ruin_10.text" text="A mountainside town, long-famed for its decorated buildings and soaring towers. However the elaborate architecture of their buildings, with their magnificent buttresses and spans, was built for form over function. Those soaring towers did not stand before an earthquake that rent the mountain open and caused the molten rock to flood onto and engulf the fleeing townsfolk."/>
  <string id="Ruin_11.name" text="Oppibynum"/>
  <string id="Ruin_11.text" text="They struck out on their own, those founders of the settlement of Haven, establishing their village beside a peaceful stream that meandered through a dense wood of rich timbers, thickly populated with game.  That same idyllic isolation, however, was to cause its downfall, as no help would arrive when bandits came with demands for 'taxes'."/>
  <string id="Ruin_12.name" text="The Elder Stones"/>
  <string id="Ruin_12.text" text="The old ways should not be forgotten. The OLD ways should not be FORGOTTEN, THE OLD WAYS WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN!"/>
  <string id="Ruin_13.name" text="Island Monastery"/>
  <string id="Ruin_13.text" text="These buildings were once called home by a group of solitary, scholarly men who studied the seas and stars looking for answers to questions no-one asked."/>
