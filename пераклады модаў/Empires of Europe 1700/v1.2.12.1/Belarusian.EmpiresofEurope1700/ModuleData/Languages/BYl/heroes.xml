  <string id="lord_danish_1b.text" text="Frederick IV was King of Denmark and Norway from 1699 until his death. Frederick was deemed a man of responsibility and industry — often regarded as the most intelligent of Denmark-Norway's absolute monarchs. He seems to have mastered the art of remaining independent of his ministers. Lacking all interest in academic knowledge, he was nevertheless a patron of culture, especially art and architecture. His main weaknesses were probably pleasure-seeking and womanising, which sometimes distracted him. He was the penultimate Danish king to make a morganatic marriage."/>

  <string id="lord_4_2.text" text="Louis XIV, also known as Louis the Great or the Sun King, was King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715. During Louis's long reign, France emerged as the leading European power and regularly asserted its military strength. A conflict with Spain marked his entire childhood, while during his personal rule, Louis fought three major continental conflicts, each against powerful foreign alliances: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years' War, and the War of the Spanish Succession."/>

Elected in 1658, Leopold ruled the Holy Roman Empire until his death in 1705, becoming the second longest-ruling Habsburg emperor (46 years and 9 months). He was both a composer and considerable patron of music. Leopold's reign is known for conflicts with the Ottoman Empire in the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) and rivalry with Louis XIV of France, a contemporary and first cousin. After more than a decade of warfare, Leopold emerged victorious in the east thanks to the military talents of Prince Eugene of Savoy."/>

  <string id="spc_forest_people_leader_0.text" text="Charles Vane was an English pirate who operated in the Bahamas during the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. In 1718, Vane was captured but agreed to stop his criminal actions and declared his intention to accept a King's Pardon; however, just months later he and his men, including Edward England and Jack Rackham, returned to piracy. Unlike some other notable pirate captains of the age like Benjamin Hornigold and Samuel Bellamy, Vane was known for his cruelty, often beating, torturing and killing sailors from ships he captured."/>
  <string id="spc_forest_people_leader_1.text" text="John Rackham was an English pirate captain operating in the Bahamas and in Cuba during the early 18th century. Rackham deposed Charles Vane from his position as captain of the Ranger, then cruised the Leeward Islands, Jamaica Channel and Windward Passage. He accepted the King's Pardon in 1719 and moved to New Providence, where he met Anne Bonny."/>
  <string id="spc_forest_people_leader_2.text" text="Anne Bonny was a pirate operating in the Caribbean, and one of the few female pirates in recorded history. At some point Bonny met Jack Rackham and the two sailed together for several months. The nature of his relationship with her is unclear and while some scholars claim it was romantic,  her own trial transcript says nothing on the matter. "/>
  <string id="spc_forest_people_leader_3.text" text="Edward England was an Irish pirate operating out of the Bahamas. The ships he sailed on included the Pearl and later the Fancy, for which England exchanged the Pearl in 1720. His flag was the classic Jolly Roger with a human skull above two crossed bones on a black background. England was known for his kindness and compassion as a leader, unlike many other pirates of the time."/>
  <string id="spc_wolfskins_leader_0.text" text="Born in England in the late 17th century, Hornigold began his pirate career in 1713, attacking merchant ships in the Bahamas. He helped to establish the Republic of Pirates in Nassau and by 1717 was the captain of one of the most heavily armed ships in the region, called the Ranger. It was at this time he appointed Edward Teach, best known in history books as Blackbeard, as his second-in-command. Mindful not to attack British-led ships during his career, his crew eventually grew tired of the tactic and Hornigold was voted out as captain."/>
  <string id="spc_wolfskins_leader_1.text" text="Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of Britain's North American colonies. His nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance. He was reported to have tied lit fuses (slow matches) under his hat to frighten his enemies. Teach was a shrewd and calculating leader who spurned the use of violence, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response that he desired from those whom he robbed. He was romanticised after his death and became the inspiration for an archetypal pirate in works of fiction across many genres."/>
  <string id="spc_wolfskins_leader_2.text" text="John Howell was an English doctor forced into the employ of pirates during the early 18th century. In 1717, he was captured by Benjamin Hornigold and was forced to treat the pirate's crew. Hornigold released him on Nassau but when French pirate Jean Bonadvis tried to force Howell aboard his ship later in April 1717, Hornigold accepted Howell back aboard to protect him."/>
  <string id="spc_wolfskins_leader_3.text" text="Samuel Bellamy, later known as Black Sam Bellamy, was an English sailor turned pirate during the early 18th century. He is best known as the wealthiest pirate in recorded history, and one of the faces of the Golden Age of Piracy. Though his known career as a pirate captain lasted little more than a year, he and his crew captured at least 53 ships."/>

Born and raised in the royal harem, Soltan Hoseyn ascended the throne with limited life experience and more or less no expertise in the affairs of the country. He was installed on the throne through the efforts of powerful great-aunt, Maryam Begum, as well as the court eunuchs, who wanted to increase their authority by taking advantage of a weak and impressionable ruler."/>

He belonged to the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin. Augustus' great physical strength earned him the nicknames the Strong, the Saxon Hercules and Iron-Hand. He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end. He is also notable for fathering a very large number of children."/>
