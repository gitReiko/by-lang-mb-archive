    <string id="CityIntroductionJDY06"  text="Zhen Nan Town County is located in the southeast of the Yan Dynasty and at the southern foot of the Qinling Mountains. It is the largest city in the south of the Yan Dynasty. Its terrain is high in the northwest, flat, with a lot of arable land, and low in the southeast, with low-lying terrain and many forests. The merchants of Yan who traveled south along the Qinling Mountains often stopped here, and at the same time promoted the local prosperity. When the black waves hit, this was the first city to be impacted. Later, it was named 'Zhennan' to commemorate the resistance to the black waves here. The Federation had to give up the idea of attacking the Yan Dynasty from the south."/>
    <string id="CityIntroductionJDY07"  text="Luo'an City is located in the north of Tianlong City, echoing with Tianlong City. Luo'an City faces Luoshui in the north and Weiran Mountain in the east. It guards the grain route to the north of the empire. It is also the last line of defense in the north of Tianlong City. The Emperor of the Yan Dynasty once defeated the five-nation coalition forces that invaded by the Luoshui. According to legend, the god of Luoshui came to teach the ancestors of the Yan people to fish with nets, raise livestock, cultivate slash-and-burn, grow mulberry and weave, produce and live, and built the first Yan city, 'Luocheng'. The Luoshui flooded several times, the ancestors of the Yan tribe moved south, and most people migrated to Tianlong City. After the attack of the black waves, they rebuilt the northern city of the empire and named it 'Luoan', which means: 'Luoshui is safe, the world is safe' ."/>
