  <string id="alfonsoXDescription" text="Born in Toledo, Alfonso was the eldest son of Ferdinand III and Elizabeth of Swabia. His mother was the paternal cousin of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, to whom Alfonso is often compared. He succeeded his father in 1252. Throughout his reign, Alfonso contends with the nobles, particularly the families of de Lara, de Haro and de Castro, all of whom are formidable soldiers and instrumental in maintaining Castile's military strength in frontier territories."/>

  <string id="henryIIIDescription" text="The current King of England is Henry III. Little is known of Henry's early life. He was named after his grandfather, Henry II. He assumed the throne after the death of his father when he was only nine in the middle of the First Baron's War; the civil war in which a group of rebellious barons waged war against King John. Henry believes that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He believes that his predecessors had allowed the status of the Crown to decline, and seeks to correct this during his reign."/>

  <string id="louisIXDescription" text="Louis was only twelve years of age when his father died and he was crowned king within the month at Reims Cathedral. His mother, Blanche, ruled France as regent during his minority, and then remained his valued adviser until her death. Today, he faces recurring conflicts with some of his realm's most powerful nobles, such as Hugh XII of Lusignan and Jean le Roux. During his reign, Louis IX has been reforming the French legal process, creating a royal justice system in which petitioners can appeal judgements directly to the king. His admirers regard him as the ideal Christian ruler. They say his skill as a knight and engaging manner with the public made him popular."/>

  <string id="richardCornwallDescription" text="Brother of current ruling King of England, Henry III, Richard was born at Winchester Castle, the second son of John, King of England. At the age of sixteen, he was given Cornwall by his brother King Henry III as a birthday present. Revenues from Cornwall helped make him one the wealthiest men in Europe. In 1257, he was elected as King of Germany by four of the seven Electoral Princes. His candidacy was opposed by Alfonso X of Castile. Pope Alexander IV and King Louis IX of France favoured Alfonso, but both were ultimately convinced by the powerful relatives of Richard's sister-in-law, Eleanor of Provence, to support Richard. Ottokar II of Bohemia, who at first voted for Richard but later elected Alfonso, eventually agreed to support the Earl of Cornwall, thus establishing the required simple majority. So Richard had to bribe only four of them, but this came at a huge cost of 28,000 marks. On 17 May 1257, he was crowned Richard King of the Romans."/>

  <string id="MindaugasDescription" text="Mindaugas was the first known Grand Duke of Lithuania and the only crowned King of Lithuania.Little is known of his origins, early life, or rise to power; he is mentioned in a 1219 treaty as an elder duke, and in 1236 as the leader of all the Lithuanians. The contemporary and modern sources discussing his ascent mention strategic marriages along with banishment or murder of his rivals. He extended his domain into regions southeast of Lithuania proper during the 1230s and 1240s. In 1250 or 1251, during the course of internal power struggles, he was baptised as a Roman Catholic; this action enabled him to establish an alliance with the Livonian Order, a long-standing antagonist of the Lithuanians. By 1245, Mindaugas was already being referred to as the highest king in certain documents. During the summer of 1253, he was crowned King of Lithuania, ruling between 300,000 and 400,000 subjects"/>

  <string id="lord_seljuk_1a.text" text="Berkyaruq was the fifth sultan of the Seljuk Empire from 1094 to 1105. The son and successor of Malik-Shah I, he reigned during the opening stages of the decline and fragmentation of the empire, which marked the rise of Turkoman atabegates and principalities, which would eventually stretch from Kirman to Anatolia and Syria. His reign was marked by internal strife, mainly against other Seljuk princes. By his death in 1105, his authority had largely vanished. His infant son Malik-Shah II briefly succeeded him, until he was killed by Berkyaruq's half-brother and rival Muhammad I Tapar."/>
