  <string id="vN4spwD1" text="Know that if you ever cross me, you'll wind up as food for the jackals."/>
  <string id="8eLXNZ7U" text="It is good to know who one fights."/>
  <string id="brGfaXyo" text="I'm not sure what to make of you, except you're either very brave or very rash, or both."/>
  <string id="Pg8vccKF" text="Never heard of you. Doubt you'll give me much trouble."/>
  <string id="TzPC5L5X" text="I'm always looking for good fighters. If you ask about me, I suspect you'll be told that I take good care of my men."/>
  <string id="JS5hKW6p" text="I'm not one of those who loves war for its own sake. But I still need reliable warriors who are true to their word. I will keep faith with all those who keep faith with me."/>
  <string id="iM76GPzK" text="I will always listen to a {?PLAYER.GENDER}woman{?}man{\?} of integrity. On the other hand, if you lack that, please do not plague me with your company."/>
  <string id="ufa20b2l" text="I'll deal with those who keep their oaths. If you're one of those who don't value their word, don't waste my time."/>
  <string id="JNb6l91E" text="If you ever want a chance for glory, you might want to consider fighting for me. One day you can tell your grandchildren that you served under my command."/>
  <string id="fHFpgitO" text="It is good to meet you. Always remember that while courage is commendable, compassion is the greatest of virtues."/>
  <string id="xsaOxeHV" text="I have heard much about you. Some men may fear a woman who is versed in the art of war, but I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal."/>
  <string id="MUHdZHFw" text="I have heard much about you. They say that you are the equal of even the bravest of men in your prowess at arms. Perhaps one day I shall try my valor against yours, either in a tournament or on the battlefield!"/>
  <string id="jxduaTUc" text="I've heard of talk of you -- the woman who knows how to fight like a man."/>
  <string id="KkWNSw9p" text="I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time."/>
  <string id="PhTv43ve" text="Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good woman to know. Let us speak together, from time to time."/>
  <string id="nJgp2MoR" text="I know your name -- and from what I hear, I'll warrant that many a grieving widow knows too. But that is no concern of mine."/>
  <string id="Wt4iJPcd" text="I've heard of you! It's very good to finally make your acquaintance."/>
  <string id="3TGug4Vb" text="I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honour and mercy matches your valor."/>
  <string id="SJ3bpDxC" text="I do not recognize your banner, but clearly you are a lady of rank. Please consider me your most humble servant."/>
  <string id="fbArcLAA" text="My lady, if you are skilled as arms as you are fair in countenance, then your enemies should indeed fear you!"/>
  <string id="aIimfZZe" text="I've heard of you. They spoke of you as an impressive warrior. They had not mentioned that you were so, em, charming."/>
  <string id="JcdmntiC" text="Ah, yes. From what they said of you, I had imagined someone whose blade was still dripping with the blood of her enemies, not someone with your grace and charms."/>
  <string id="WbAAkcbw" text="It's an honor to meet you, my lady."/>
  <string id="QhkM71ap" text="It's an honor to meet you, good sir."/>
  <string id="9uH1NdsT" text="You're a handsome devil, aren't you? Bet you're a load of trouble, though."/>
  <string id="TvqjhDaQ" text="So, my young lion. You have the look of someone who may go far, if they don't wind up dead."/>
  <string id="6l8ty6Dr" text="Pleasure to meet you."/>
  <string id="lcPeNFTN" text="I am glad to meet you."/>
  <string id="OgzAlCkk" text="I am still recovering from the bruises you gave me."/>
  <string id="9ZHhYooG" text="Remember how I beat you, one-on-one? Are you back for more?"/>
  <string id="bbjLFWhP" text="I won our last duel, but you fought well. I wouldn't blame you if you wished for a rematch."/>
  <string id="i1RXpQxR" text="Remember our duel? It was a good fight. But with the advantage I have now, I'm afraid I can't afford to be so sporting."/>
  <string id="MSiuWF7V" text="We can take no more! We have raised the standard of rebellion, and will fight the people's enemies until our just demands are met."/>
  <string id="te2DSMtg" text="We're not putting up with it any more. We will spill the blood of the oppressors and anyone who stands in the way of our just wrath."/>

  <string id="s6xlGuTH" text="I will honor the terms of the parley if you do likewise."/>
  <string id="g3oFsCtd" text="You asked for a parley. I will trust you will honor the customs of war and attempt no tricks."/>
  <string id="T0Cdfsx2" text="You asked for a parley. If you're tempted to try any tricks, do know I have some archers standing by to keep you honest."/>
  <string id="cGuzIVlk" text="They say you have travelled quite widely. Tell me a bit about your journeys..."/>
  <string id="sJNrVlXa" text="Heard you get around quite a bit... So... Tell me a bit about your travels, then."/>
  <string id="L6FSmeIv" text="They say you've travelled widely. Such terrible times we live in, so much hardship. What do you think of what you've seen?"/>
  <string id="BbVpiTdi" text="You are, I hear, a man of the world, as they say. Tell me a bit about your journeys."/>
  <string id="f3X79aDs" text="So... I've heard you've travelled around a fair bit. No doubt you've seen a lot of strange and awful things. Maybe you've done a few strange and awful things. Go on, tell me a bit about your journeys. I promise not to be shocked."/>
  <string id="sEfAuErj" text="Some people say you will go far... Suppose you were to rise to a position of power. What would you do?"/>
  <string id="rndbZI9I" text="Now don't take this the wrong way, but some would say that you're aiming a bit beyond your station. But lets say your rise in the world. What would you do?"/>
  <string id="dniQq29H" text="I shall put this bluntly. You are not from a good family. Some would say you are setting your sights too high. But suppose you were to rise in the world. What would you do?"/>
  <string id="9LwkLxo7" text="You may be of humble birth, but you seem like the type who will rise in the world. Suppose you were to come to a position of power and responsibility. How would you use it?"/>
  <string id="xb5RGe0W" text="Thanks again for taking on that little matter for me. Best of luck."/>
  <string id="o4talwN5" text="Yeah... Thanks again for agreeing to handle that matter for me."/>
  <string id="ZlA0uc8z" text="Thank you again for agreeing to handle that problem of mine. Best of luck with it."/>
  <string id="XBbdhx4M" text="Again, I'm glad to have your assistance."/>
  <string id="L2PFxbD3" text="So... Not long ago, you betrayed my trust. Do we really have anything to discuss?"/>
  <string id="pQkiu5qf" text="Would you like me to give you another task, so that you can betray me again?"/>
  <string id="TUwY7IKc" text="So... You really did me over. Not sure we have much to talk about now, after that."/>
  <string id="7pQ3y21E" text="Thank you again for all your help."/>
  <string id="27KUtWGA" text="You came through on that task I gave you. I thank you."/>
  <string id="LkVCTVMx" text="I thank you for what you did for me. You kept your word. Not everyone is so dependable these days."/>
  <string id="tRSD2C3k" text="That task you took on for me. Very nicely done."/>
  <string id="A40Z3egp" text="That job you did for me... Nice work."/>
  <string id="J0wLOV3u" text="I know that the task I gave you was not easy... Well, let's not speak of that anymore."/>
  <string id="Gp3l5fjI" text="So, about that task I gave you... Well, I can only hope that you gave it your best try, and you'd said you would."/>
  <string id="aFbkjgVe" text="So, you weren't able to complete that task... Well, sometimes these things are out of our hands... and sometimes not. But let us not dwell on this."/>
  <string id="UehvSvLD" text="That job I gave you... I'd say you let me down."/>
  <string id="pgIaAnBt" text="So that problem I asked you to take care of... Didn't go so well, I hear."/>
  <string id="c7hrnOUE" text="I guess that task I gave you didn't work out."/>
  <string id="HwsshsMz" text="I'm glad that we could come to an understanding on that recent matter."/>
  <string id="qB3wfM1f" text="I'm glad that you and I could reach an agreement, earlier."/>
  <string id="8GDgJCB4" text="If you're ever looking for stout warriors, friend, you should think about hiring the Company of the Boar. The stoutest lads in Vlandia flock to our banner. Because if you don't hire us, your enemy might."/>
  <string id="bNReoRmt" text="If you ever find yourself in a position to hire warriors, you should consider the Legion of the Betrayed. We know what it means to honor your word and contract, as we have seen the price of breaking faith."/>
  <string id="ELtT9ctL" text="You may know of the Skolderbroda. On the battlefield, we are second to none. We expect to be paid according to our worth, and that is not cheap, but if we take your coin, you will have our oath to honor the terms of the contract, to our death if necessary."/>
  <string id="6UBdsXlo" text="Perhaps one day we shall see each other on a battlefield. You shall know the Ghilman by the splendor of our steeds and the shimmer of our steel. If we are on your side, you may rejoice. If we are your enemy, you may save yourself a great deal of trouble by running away before the fighting starts."/>
  <string id="a5LChqbr" text="The common folk of these lands need someone looking after them. That's where our Brotherhood comes in. You'll hear us called bandits or robbers. Don't believe a word of it."/>
  <string id="48g7K7Zi" text="When you walk these roads, my friend, know that nothing escapes the notice of the Hidden Hand. Lords and emperors come and go, but we remain."/>
  <string id="sswCmQZ2" text="They call us the Lake Rats, but we prefer to be known as the free people of the marshes. No prince or boyar can make us bow our heads and scrape our knees. Know that, and we can probably get along fine."/>
  <string id="U9u8Qeu4" text="Perhaps you've heard of the Wolfskins, traveller. We are beasts. Know that so long as we eat no cooked meat, wear no woven cloth, and sleep under no roof, we cannot be touched by the laws of men. So tread carefully with us."/>
  <string id="QpBmbygb" text="You may have heard of us - the Eleftheroi. Our fathers were thieves and runaways and troublemakers - we won't deny it. We came here because they didn't want us anywhere else. But I'll tell you this - if the empire survives, it'll be thanks to men like us, doing the hard bloody work out here in the wild fields, not those who sleep comfortably in their beds."/>
  <string id="NeUilOqh" text="We welcome strangers into our lands. The woods are wide, and there is game to be hunted and food to be gathered, enough for all. But there are some who come here to steal from us, to enslave us, or to tax us. Every spring, the bodies of those thieves are discovered in the thaw."/>
  <string id="YayEAKaI" text="Perhaps you have not heard of the Jawwal. Well, when you cross the desert, far from oasis and spring, in a land that others scorn, with thorns fit only for goats and camels, then you are in our domain."/>
  <string id="DLV6F3ob" text="Maybe you have not heard of the Karakhergit. We do venture much into the sewn lands, the corrupt lands. We bow to no Khan. We sew no grain. We keep to the old ways, out amid the great grasses."/>
  <string id="caKCwoPM" text="The Beni Zilal are the keepers of the secret. We watch from the shadows. Make foes of us at your peril."/>
  <string id="iOnsulPb" text="You may have heard of us. Men call us the Embers of the Flame. Generations ago, Heaven instructed us to prepare for a great cleansing of the land. Until that day, we smolder in silence. But when that day comes, our righteous wrath shall burn forth."/>
