    <string id="0Ioje6ia" text="Ahoy there. Furl your sails and ship your oars.[if:convo_mocking_revenge]" />
    <string id="0xqmpdIc" text="Ahoy! As it appears your poor floundering tub can't outrun us, we might as well have a little chat. Perhaps you'd like to introduce yourself?" />
    <string id="1Z0PBOPJ" text="I'm a sailor out of Quyaz. We venture further from our homes than anyone else on the coast, and I believe that my knowledge of winds, currents and stars is the equal of any of my peers." />
    <string id="2e2OtohH" text="Where I come from, parents are to be honored and obeyed." />
    <string id="2eG5uizX" text="No nation ever prospered on the seas without a bit of corsairing." />
    <string id="361sEjHd" text="Really? I suppose I'll be getting my hands dirty today, then.[ib:aggressive][if:convo_bared_teeth]" />
    <string id="3Mu5N4Pr" text="I am from the Svalfjord, the further reaches of the Nordlands. We hunt whales in small boats. We trust our lives to each other's skill. If you have a ship to crew, you will find no one better." />
    <string id="3WjLejeG" text="Who captains this ship? I would know whom I slay." />
    <string id="3ylOZFJi" text="Ahoy! Who are you? Speak, before I send you to the bottom." />
    <string id="4xgNsle7" text="Ahoy! You appear be a foe, and in a minute I will order my ship to close with you and take you. But first, I would know your name." />
    <string id="5rXHns1H" text="I remember when you and I last fought together. We had good ships and valiant crews. It's a pity we did not prevail." />
    <string id="6GDZHADD" text="Strike your sails and ship your oars, or we shall attack.[ib:warrior][if:convo_angry]" />
    <string id="6y0CvuT8" text="Ahoy! Do you wish to speak, before we attack?" />
    <string id="89rT5fDr" text="Hmf. Without kin, we are as beasts." />
    <string id="8c3aIeaQ" text="My father was a smith, and I learned his trade. I know such skills are in high demand. I will gladly sharpen blades and repair armor for my pay, but the one thing I ask from any master is the chance to rise in the world." />
    <string id="97mvKD9y" text="By then I had quite a few debts. Well, I sold my herd and my farmhouse to pay my creditors, and here I am, looking for a new source of income. I'll miss Beinland though. Herding in the lonely moors, hunting in the quiet woods. I like to roam the land, and if you're looking for a man to scout ahead, well, I may be him." />
    <string id="9CLh70Zn" text="Ahoy there! There's a tax on ships in these waters, sailor, paid either in coin or in blood.[if:convo_mocking_revenge]" />
    <string id="9n90mLG1" text="I am from Charas. I don't know how much you know of its recent past." />
    <string id="9wYQGoha" text="So that's where I grew up on, on a gull-splattered bit of rock, living on fish and seaweed and rainwater, because of course the baron's informant had taken my family's land in his absence. But I can safely say that no one knows the sea like I do, as the wind can come at you hard from any direction at any time of day, and a fisherman who can't slip between two rocks a stone's throw apart with a breeze hard on his beam is food for the sharks." />
    <string id="a0z0uxsb" text="queen of the Nordvyg" />
    <string id="aaQpQHsQ" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Is that you? It doesn't look like you can escape your fate, does it? Let's see if the sea accepts your vile corpse, or if it just vomits it back up." />
    <string id="acbUlz1E" text="You want to hear a story, eh? I'll tell you the short version. The long, well, that could keep a longhouse entertained for a half-dozen midwinter nights. Beinlandings... In matters of the law, they don't like to make things simple. Or cheap." />
    <string id="aLQdv0ZX" text="I am {CONVERSATION_CHARACTER.LINK}, of the {CLAN_NAME}. It is unseemly to boast, so I will leave it to others to tell you of our deeds. It is a conversation best had on a long winter's night, for it may take some considerable time." />
    <string id="AMiXtNfV" text="Good. Now be careful out there. World's full of thieves, not all of them as kind as we are.[ib:closed][rf:convo_bemused]" />
    <string id="arZJwHKC" text="Ahoy! If you can hear me at that distance, come no further. Whose ship is this?" />
    <string id="Ax8iqIzC" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Ahoy! I hope you have been enjoying fair weather and good seas." />
    <string id="AYMKLPXY" text="Ahoy! I know your ship. {STR_SALUTATION}, isn't it? Do you and I have anything to talk about?" />
    <string id="B2bP9gWK" text="Only a scoundrel would boast of such base behavior." />
    <string id="bfuBBrTq" text="Oh aye, you can buy your lives. I wouldn't push too hard on the price if I were you, though, as you might say it's a bit of a seller's market.[ib:hip][rf:convo_bemused]" />
    <string id="bRrHfVbg" text="You, over there! Who commands you? Know that we mean to take you or to sink you." />
    <string id="bsXMiU47" text="Peace to you, stranger, and fair seas. I do not know your ship. To whom do I speak?" />
    <string id="bTBZExBm" text="{STR_SALUTATION}! When I saw that hull all covered with barnacles, those tangled ropes, that cluttered deck, I knew it must be you!" />
    <string id="bYjzSZeE" text="I was sent by my village as a fyrdman to our jarl, Grykka Half-an-Ear. I was eager to fight and win wealth and glory, but I knew a bit about metalwork and he needed a smith, so instead of joining his warriors they put me in a sooty alcove at the base of the wall and told to pump the bellows and hammer nails and horseshoes." />
    <string id="bZK0CJvM" text="I've waited a long time for this day. Have a good look around you, for soon your eyes will have little to see but the inside of a shark's belly." />
    <string id="c1aP8VnP" text="Ahoy, there! I know you. Be careful, now, as you might find that you've caught a bigger fish than you first reckoned." />
    <string id="cAafekbv" text="Some day I hope to tell my story to a dozen of my sons, as we feast for the solstice in my hall, so that they shall follow my example and sail out into the world to make their fortunes. Until then, I will settle for telling it to strangers in taverns like yourself." />
    <string id="CbaWIHqc" text="a jarlinna" />
    <string id="cc9JuNoL" text="But the Baron dey Cortain, who led the siege, wasn't terribly interested in their reasons. He went up and down the coast, hanging anyone with a boat with five leagues of Charas who could not give a full account of himself. An informant put my father's name on the list, and so we like so many others fled to the islands of the gulf." />
    <string id="clfsNbtf" text="Ahoy! Greetings to you! May I ask who captains this vessel?" />
    <string id="cm3dWaRL" text="Some men persist in folly unto death, and there is nothing you can do." />
    <string id="cUi56tqb" text="You, over there! With which bold seafarer do I have the pleasure of speaking?" />
    <string id="d5lpGY8m" text="One day, soon after I came of age, I took a hundred sheep from our flocks, sold them, and bought a small snekya. I hired some men too, and set off to raid the coast of Sturgia. But of course I was a poor judge of warriors, and when the boyar's druzhina set upon us they scattered, and burned my ship." />
    <string id="danasORQ" text="The Nords are a people made by the sea. The very name of their home, the Nordvyg, refers to the icy stretch of glacier-cut coastline that links their scattered settlements. Until recently, their towns were little more than a shrine or market beside a fjord or estuary, surrounded by a palisade. Some make a modest living by farming barley and raising sheep, but those with ambition must venture forth in their longships to trade, plunder or fight for hire." />
    <string id="DLDozLY8" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... The seas have delivered you into our hands." />
    <string id="DN6XgaS3" text="The Vanni hoped the other Nords would flee. But they did not know them. One of my brothers came to me in secret. He told me to poison my Vanni husband's family, like I was that old queen of Sturgland. Hah! One day my family demands that I wed this man and have his children, the next they say to kill him? I wasn't having it. I slipped off that night, and wish to see neither brothers nor husband again." />
    <string id="dPAqhZx4" text="Ahoy! If have anything to say, then say it. But try anything tricky and we'll send you right to the bottom." />
    <string id="eedfzuGw" text="At any rate, a year with the Vanni has taught me much about the woods, about herbs, the treatment of wounds and fevers. I reckon I could be of good use to a company of warriors." />
    <string id="elvtV0kV" text="Well, let no one say we didn't give you a chance.[ib:aggressive][if:convo_annoyed]" />
    <string id="EQTgCk0z" text="What is it with the fishermen of Charas? Are there no fish left to catch, that they must profit from smuggling and rebellion?" />
    <string id="eSZEyhqR" text="My next voyage was on a felucca out of Zeonica heading eastward to Danustica. Pirates took us, and burnt it to the waterline. Then I took service on a dromon, fitted as a privateer, but we were caught by an unseasonal dust-storm that rolled off the Jabal Tamar and smashed us into a rock in the Gulf of Charas. Each time, destiny saw fit to spare me after first having paupered me." />
    <string id="EYBQaaCH" text="I seek work. I will tell you my story, so that you are in no doubt of my skills." />
    <string id="ezosNKvK" text="Ahoy, there! May I have the pleasure of knowing who captains this vessel?" />
    <string id="fqcljZxA" text="You! Heave to, you bastards, or we'll cut every last one of your throats.[if:convo_bared_teeth]" />
    <string id="fqGPu6J2" text="Ahoy! ... What ship is this, and who's the captain?" />
    <string id="fSMAEYOt" text="Ahoy! So, who captains this here wallowing sow of a vessel?" />
    <string id="FVwyrKBh" text="See, I came to Beinland some years ago, like many from the Nordvyg. Land for the taking, they said, and all men stand equal before the law. I found one unsettled valley with a stream and lush grass, and built my home there. I should have asked why no one done so before." />
    <string id="GCiHxPkG" text="I am {CONVERSATION_CHARACTER.LINK}. I will not boast to you of my lineage. A true son of the North aims to surpass his fathers, not live off of their reputation." />
    <string id="gGLcvhD9" text="More Nords followed, however. I was living in my husband's village, and the Vanni complained that the coming and going ruined the hunting. They thought this voided the deal. There were talks, but they went nowhere. So the Vanni killed some Nords in the fields - though not my brothers, as a consideration to me." />
    <string id="GgUnrDeT" text="There was a dispute over a whale carcass. I do not remember what caused it, exactly, but my father felt he had sole claim to it. He cursed the others and said words that could not be unsaid. He would not apologize, and had to leave the village. So it was just me, him and my uncle, living alone on the coast, in a shelter dug into the turf with a hole in the roof to let out smoke. " />
    <string id="gjU6kqvS" text="I am from the Jumne. Although I am Nord by birth, I have lived among the Vanni. I know much about herbs, and the art of healing." />
    <string id="GpxxpwcX" text="Ahoy! {STR_SALUTATION}... I'd know your vessel anywhere! Look at the state of that ship. I'm surprised it doesn't just sink into the sea out of shame. " />
    <string id="Gtdo9T3r" text="I have sworn that I shall not return home, unless I am indeed standing at the helm of a fine ship that my brother could envy. I have fought for Vlandian barons, imperial archons, even once an noyan of the east. I have fought in many battles, some on land and some at sea. But lords are stingy, and I think none has rewarded me according to my due." />
    <string id="H9CuYSX3" text="We did well to defeat those pirates back there. The common enemy of mankind, so they say." />
    <string id="hBxcDZjk" text="At any rate, if you are looking for a helmsman, I doubt you will find a better one." />
    <string id="hCB5tRmu" text="So... Perhaps you have a need of warriors, or captains for your ships. If you are a generous lord, then I can be a worthy follower." />
    <string id="HEaZpWIk" text="Ahoy! I want to speak to your captain." />
    <string id="hl0oYfvf" text="I was born in a farm near Throndelag, but my family moved to the new lands near the Jumne river. If I see neither place again as long as I live, I will have no regret." />
    <string id="HR4IUF9S" text="Ahoy! Is that you, {STR_SALUTATION}? It's good to see you." />
    <string id="hs9ntbwB" text="But you know what complications can come of love. The daughter was late in her time, and soon people would be asking questions. I helped myself to a blade and a horse in place of my long-unpaid wages and rode away as fast as I could. Maybe I'll go back 20 years from now and greet the new jarl with a cheerful, 'Hello, son!'" />
    <string id="HZKEfJ3q" text="My father insisted that we would still hunt. It was madness, just three people in a boat, but what else could we do? One day a whale that he harpooned dragged us far out to sea. When we were struggling to row back, a storm blew up, and sank the boat. My father and I swam ashore but my uncle drowned. I'd had enough. I left the next day." />
    <string id="iBhK0Itq" text="Despite my sufferings I still yearn for travel and traffic. And none of these wrecks was any fault of my own. Misfortune is a good teacher, they say, and I think my knowledge is second to none in terms of what not to do when in command of a ship." />
    <string id="id6YPGQk" text="I am {CONVERSATION_CHARACTER.LINK}, of the {CLAN_NAME}. One table in the High Hall is reserved for our fallen, and two more for those we have slain." />
    <string id="Idu09mwb" text="Great are your sorrows, but greater still your perseverance! Surely it shall be rewarded with riches." />
    <string id="ijmUcJWt" text="Turns out my neighbor, Odig, was a difficult one. People say he had troll-blood. One day he shows up with his retainers and tells me my sheep had broken into his fields, when they hadn't, and demanded compensation. I told him to go away. Then I started to find my sheep dead in their pastures, and then one of my herdsman. I decided to take my case before the Thing." />
    <string id="ipdOFEna" text="You, over there! Peace to you! Who captains your ship?" />
    <string id="IPpqJCVq" text="Well... Unless I reckon the odds falsely, I'd say you have a good chance of getting wet shortly. I hope you can swim." />
    <string id="iqQj3bF7" text="I trust you have been keeping well, enjoying the salt air and sending the miscreants of the sea to their watery graves." />
    <string id="ivLxIasE" text="Ahoy! You want something with us? You might find you've caught more than you bargained for." />
    <string id="IWzzeHb6" text="I am from Charas. The islands of the coast are rich in mackeral and tuna but treacherous, with many small currents and unpredictable winds. We reckon ourselves the finest sailors in Calradia, if you don't mind my saying." />
    <string id="jAOcpROC" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I shall stain the seas with your blood." />
    <string id="jCVcj25s" text="Nothing makes a finer warrior than a hunger to prove yourself that can never be satisfied." />
    <string id="jmqfmCCX" text="So here's where I come in... Let's say you have acquired a cheap Aserai shabak, by one means or the other. It was intended as a ship that could move goods from one place to another as cheaply as possible. But you want it refitted to be faster, with a lead-sheeted belly and some towers for archers, never mind why. My family and I specialized in adding them." />
    <string id="jZTgmQxr" text="A cruel fate to suffer, just for bring food to your fellow-men." />
    <string id="K1VKZiEr" text="Ahoy! Damn your eyes and stay out of our way, you clumsy lubbers. Who captains you?" />
    <string id="k74H9HWC" text="I'm from Zeonica. In my youth, the archon was one Sulvanis, father of the current Garios. Now, let us say your empire is at peace with the Aserai and Vlandians, but their merchants are cutting into your pockets and you expect to be at war in the future. If one of your mariners sailed out of harbor with one ship and came back with two, would you question them too carefully?" />
    <string id="KfUc1Hhl" text="The Thinglaw, though... To gain a hearing I needed a chieftain to back my case. I found one, but he brought a great retinue along with him, which I had to feast. The Thing ruled in my favor and outlawed Odig - everyone hated him - but to enforce the judgment , to take his head and his property, well, I was on my own there. My chief offered to provide armed men, but not for free." />
    <string id="kObd6NR1" text="Heave to and prepare to be boarded, or fight.[ib:warrior][if:convo_angry]" />
    <string id="kt6E6hZK" text="So... I can cast a harpoon, and handle a boat that is being dragged by a whale in its death throes. I think I would be of use in any ship's crew, if the pay is right." />
    <string id="LCamKf8a" text="Ahoy! May I speak to your captain?" />
    <string id="lO21CPat" text="{?RULER.GENDER}Jarlinna{?}Jarl{\?} {RULER.NAME}" />
    <string id="lzbTtpkY" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Peace to you... I hope the sea air is doing you good." />
    <string id="mgT3OzDk" text="I hear you seized one of my trading vessels. I am not pleased." />
    <string id="msWVJl9k" text="I am {CONVERSATION_CHARACTER.LINK} of the {CLAN_NAME}." />
    <string id="mypuUHZ0" text="Pirates, and those that help them, are the common enemy of mankind." />
    <string id="OATyZfqg" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I hope the seas have been treating you well." />
    <string id="Ob4WaDsD" text="I heard you fought ship to ship with {DEFEATED_PARTY_LEADER}, and won." />
    <string id="odtTWIET" text="I do not know your ship. Who commands you?" />
    <string id="ONjs1uCt" text="Sounds like a fine source of income for the old clans of Beinland." />
    <string id="OzSIBEag" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Ahoy! So somehow you've managed to keep yourself afloat since we last met. It's good to see you, you worthless lubber!" />
    <string id="P0NKsfwf" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Pirates like you may put on airs, but they all end up the same way, dangling from the yardarm of their betters." />
    <string id="PadfbuOo" text="Ahoy, there! If you could be so kind, could you try to steer your lump of flotsam out of our way?" />
    <string id="PbCPzAFn" text="a jarl" />
    <string id="PG95aHx1" text="We moved to the Jumne because we heard there was farmland for the taking. When we arrived, we found there were Vanni already there, but at first they did not mind our presence. They lived in the woods and left us the open meadows by the river. I was given in marriage to the Vanni chieftain's son to seal the arrangement, along with some cloth and axe-heads." />
    <string id="pkb1Qb75" text="Ahoy! Keep your distance, lest you foul our sails. Who is in command over there?" />
    <string id="PnlGtqe5" text="king of the Nordvyg" />
    <string id="PwBHqr0V" text="Nordic" />
    <string id="q5Mq29ZZ" text="Ahoy! We know you're an enemy, so do not think to take us unawares." />
    <string id="Q6bKmIzq" text="Bjalthir" />
    <string id="qdpW0xjM" text="We'll take it. Now best get your sails over the horizon before we change your minds.[ib:closed][rf:convo_bared_teeth]" />
    <string id="qedxehRv" text="I will say this. Many lords condemn us, but relatively few are willing to pass up the opportunity to employ us, at least not when they have ships to maintain." />
    <string id="qxOpJrbP" text="Yes, certainly family can be demanding..." />
    <string id="qYa1Ubs7" text="I shall mark down your name. Now, do not take it amiss if I do not invite you to dine on board, for the world is a treacherous place, and I have learned to be wary." />
    <string id="R2LtaPrL" text="I come from Svalfjord. Farther north than that, people cannot live. There is ice in our bay for six months of the year. In the summer we hunt whales, black whales, which are smaller than most but are cunning and can still sink you if you're not careful. Each summer we gather in our boats and drive the whales into the fjord. Since I was a girl I would go with my father and uncle and several others from the village.  " />
    <string id="r7MmKgXb" text="Ahoy! Whose ship is this?" />
    <string id="rCR9Z2uu" text="Alas, our captain was a braggart. We were headed to Revyl with a cargo of dates and dyes. He wished to show his knowledge of the Bay of Ortygia, and took a quick route between the islands. Of course he was dashed on the rocks. I seized a timber, and was washed shore with a dozen other half-drowned survivors who had what I guess you could call luck." />
    <string id="rgGeCszp" text="I am {CONVERSATION_CHARACTER.LINK}, of the {CLAN_NAME}. We are wound-smiths and wave-riders, raven-feeders and ring-breakers." />
    <string id="RPsjP1bm" text="the Nords" />
    <string id="RqlG4sWy" text="Greetings! Do I speak to the captain of this ship, my lady?" />
    <string id="RQsjEaaL" text="I am a skilled mariner. I am from Quyaz. The blood of the Kannic people runs in my veins, and Kannic blood is half saltwater, so they say. I took to the sea at an early age as a navigator's apprentice, and by 20 I had accumulated enough to buy a share in a ship sailing the Jade Sea." />
    <string id="SCTqjH0j" text="Just get yourself a lord and master. Much simpler than setting your own course though this world." />
    <string id="SJtKprVI" text="Who are you? Strike your sails and ship your oars, or prepare to fight." />
    <string id="sO0VNZN3" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Is that you on that ship? It's been a while." />
    <string id="sXw6ME3A" text="Ahoy! What's your name? Forgive me if we have spoken before and I do not recall, for I have met many promising captains only to hear later they were swallowed by the deep." />
    <string id="T0KbGaWF" text="I don't know you... If you have anything to say, say it quickly. The sharks are hungry and I would not keep them waiting." />
    <string id="Tebbwgcp" text="I can only hope that Heaven has prepared a reward for all the sorrow and suffering that I am about to relate to you." />
    <string id="Tfk39abh" text="I'm from the Nordvyg, but moved to Beinland. I bought a herd of sheep there, which I hoped would make my fortune, but between several bad winters and some disputes with my neighbors, well, that all came to naught. I'm much poorer than I was before, but at least I'm a bit wiser for having studied at the foot of such a harsh teacher as that island. If you're looking for someone to lead your company through the wilds, well, I may be him." />
    <string id="TMdL4gJH" text="My father was one of the Sea-Victuallers. Perhaps you have heard of them. When the guildmaster of Charas brought in the Brotherhood of the Woods and rebelled against the Vlandian king, the fishermen of the coast brought supplies to the besieged city. They did it for pay, mind, as starving cities will pay dearly for moldy bread and minnows, not because they believed a word of the Brotherhood's mad promises of a world without lords and ladies and taxes and tithes." />
    <string id="tpBIsbT1" text="Right. So unless you ship your oars now and let us board you, you're going down.[ib:warrior][if:convo_angry]" />
    <string id="TULO2Md5" text="I suppose you owed nothing to a master who took you for granted." />
    <string id="tUnYGiaE" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... We sail at your command." />
    <string id="tWcTygzR" text="Good, good. I much prefer a straight-up deal to rummaging through your gut afterward to see what you might have hid there.[ib:hip][rf:convo_bemused]" />
    <string id="u6XRjWZN" text="I grew up in Zeonica. Corsairing is an honorable profession there. It hones the skills of the empire's sailors, between wars. I specialize in the construction and modification of corsair vessels, and may even have sailed on one from time to time." />
    <string id="UTlUqXsI" text="I do not know your ship. Who are you? What do you want with us?" />
    <string id="uwCp5zUL" text="Name the sum, and be quick about it, or we'll just feed you to the sharks.[ib:hip][rf:convo_bared_teeth]" />
    <string id="UwhbV9SC" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Is that you? Please be brief. The winds are with us and I have no time to waste." />
    <string id="V3yLFapl" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Our ship is at your command." />
    <string id="V61Dy2Pt" text="I remember when we last met and battled, ship to ship." />
    <string id="V9612yv0" text="You, over there! Tell me the name of the captain brave enough to put to sea in such a leaky jumble of planks as your ship." />
    <string id="vPNcuore" text="But a smith's life has its advantages. The ladies of the castle, you see, sometimes needed their jewelry repaired. I was down there hammering away in the sweat and the smoke, and I suppose I was one of the few interesting things to see in that freezing fortress if you're a jarl's daughter with a great deal of time on her hands." />
    <string id="vRB6q8Cq" text="Yeah, okay, maybe also consider that your destiny wants you to remain on dry land." />
    <string id="VRfSzgtn" text="So... What am I doing in this dingy tavern, far from my homeland? Well, I suppose it's because I was taught that it's a fine thing to be ambitious, to seize what chances fate gives you..." />
    <string id="W7FarbyE" text="You can't outrun us. Yield or die.[ib:warrior][if:convo_aggressive]" />
    <string id="wOLcO7Ey" text="Well, I'll not deny it. It'll be a real pleasure to feed you to the sharks." />
    <string id="WVQtu5ab" text="Ahoy! Keep a bowshot's length away, or more, until I know if you're friend or foe." />
