    <string id="82aSnTOv" text="The Orthling led the colonists of Beinland against King Volbjorn during the wars of unification. After their defeat they bowed to the inevitable, and offered their chief's daughter, Asgotha, as bride to the king's younger and far more popular brother Surnir. But the marriage, despite its inauspicious origins, turned out well. Asgotha was a shield maiden, and the couple fought side-by-side in battles, up until the day that Surnir was slain in a skirmish with the Sturgians. The new king Halthdar has confirmed her as jarl of Beinland, but many of her kinsmen chaff under the humiliation of Skylfing rule." />
    <string id="Bule74H4" text="Were Halthdar the Golden a petty chieftain or jarl, he would no doubt be beloved of all the warriors who followed him into battle and sat at his feast-table afterwards, to be showered with praise and rings. But he is a king, in a land that is still unhappy to be a kingdom. He is blamed by his jarls for the sins of his father, Volbjorn the Hungry, who created the Nordvyg with blood and trickery, and many long to return to the old days when they answered to no one." />
    <string id="GPf0avBi" text="Grykka Half-an-Ear came from a poor offshoot of the Kjoldings, and was little thought-of until the night that his uncle the jarl and his followers were trapped in their mead-hall by unknown warriors and the roof set alight. His hasty confirmation as jarl by the old king Volbjorn, left little doubt that he was the culprit, and had been suborned by the ruthless unifier of the Nordvyg. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, he is viewed with suspicion by Volbjorn's son and heir Halthdar." />
    <string id="OAvlqAql" text="Ilrika was the wife of Volbjorn the Hungry, first King of the Nordvyg. She was a caretaker of a woodland shrine, the keeper of secret rituals, and every bit as ambitious as her husband. When Volbjorn died, Ilrika's machinations ensured that her son, Halthdar, had no serious rivals for the throne. When his rule was secure, she soon died - or so the royal household claimed. Others say she returned to the woods, and some claim to see her wandering on moonless nights, ensuring none dare challenge the dynasty." />
    <string id="wKMRsw16" text="Many over the years have styled themselves King of the Nordvyg, but Volbjorn the Hungry is the first for whom it was more than an empty title. As a young man he served the Empire as a mercenary, accumulating a huge horde of gold. With it, he returned home to transform his jarldom into a kingdom. Some who resisted him were defeated in battle, others were bought, and others found out that someone whom they trusted could be bought. It is whispered that, when Volbjorn was on his deathbed, he ordered himself sealed alive inside his barrow with his gold, so that greed and sorcery could transform him, and he could count it every night." />
